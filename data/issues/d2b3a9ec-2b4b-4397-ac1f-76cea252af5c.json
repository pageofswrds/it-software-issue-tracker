How to prevent that problem? How to recover data lost in the Word crash? This post from\nMiniTool Partition Wizard\nwill show you all.\nMicrosoft Word Keeps Crashing\nMicrosoft Word is a word processing program developed by Microsoft Corporation, part of Microsoft Office. Many people will use it to deal with work. However, many people report that they have encountered the Microsoft Word crashing issue.\nTip: Some people report that Microsoft Word crashes immediately once they open a word file. If you are also in this case, please read this post:\nMicrosoft Word Won’t Open On Windows & Mac: How To Fix It\n. The methods in this post may solve your problem.\nIn this post, I only talk about this case: the Microsoft Word software crashes suddenly while you are editing your word files. Sometimes, you will get this error message “There was a problem with Microsoft Word and your recent work may be lost. We apologize for the inconvenience.” But sometimes no error message is displayed.\nWhy does Word keep crashing? As we all know, power failures will cause Word to stop/crash immediately. But this kind of crash is occasional. If your Word crashes frequently, it’s possible that your Word has some problems. For example:\nYou have installed some third-party Add-ins that are incompatible with Microsoft Word.\nYou have deleted some components of Microsoft Word, making it corrupt.\nYou have made some improper Microsoft Office settings.\nHow to Recover Word Files from Crashes\nIn most cases, the Microsoft Word crashing issue comes with data loss. When Microsoft Word crashes, the first thing you should do is to recover the data. However, as we all know, when a program is running, it deals with data in the RAM, volatile memory. Therefore, once the software crashes or the power is down, the data will lose permanently.\nThen, can you recover the data after the Microsoft Word crashes? This depends on whether you have enabled the AutoRecover feature. This feature will regularly create an AutoRecover file that can be used to recover the file when the Word crashes suddenly.\nIn general, this feature is enabled by default but the interval time is 10 minutes by default, which is too long in some cases.\nTip:\nIf you have closed or quit the file manually, then the AutoRecover file is gone.\nYou can shorten the interval time through the following steps:\nOpen a Word file and click the\nFile\nfeature in the upper left corner.\nClick the\nOptions\nfeature in the left panel to open the\nWord Options\nwindow.\nIn the new window, click the\nSave\ntab in the left panel.\nUnder\nSave documents\n, ensure the\nSave SutoRecover information every xx minutes\nfeature is ticked, and then set a proper time for it.\nAfter all is completed, click the\nOK\nbutton to save and apply changes.\nWhen the AutoRecover feature is enabled, if your Word crashes during editing, you can recover part of your data through the following steps:\nOpen the Word file you are editing.\nIn the left side of the Word file, you will see a\nDocument Recovery\nIn this section, Microsoft Word will list all files recovered by it and the list will show the name and the creation time of file. Then, you can choose a file to recover.\nClick a file from the list to open it so that you can check whether this file is the one that you want to recover most. If it is, click the\nSave\nThen, name this file and choose the save location.\n2 Ways to Fix Microsoft Office Click-to-Run High Disk Usage\nThis post offers 2 ways to help solve the Microsoft Office Click to Run high disk usage issue on Windows 10.\nRead More\nHow to Recover Deleted Word Files\nIf your Word file is saved but you deleted it mistakenly, you can recover it using third-party data recovery software like MiniTool Partition Wizard.

Ahuja\nImagine this: you're ready to draft a masterpiece in Microsoft Word, and just as you begin typing, it crashes and closes. Frustrating? Definitely. But don't panic! There are several straightforward steps you can take to resolve this issue. Here’s the complete guide:\nStep 1: Open Word in Safe Mode\nThe first thing to try is opening Word in Safe Mode, which temporarily disables certain features. This helps identify whether the issue stems from a plugin. To open Word in Safe Mode:\nHold down the\nCTRL\nkey.\nClick on the Word icon to open the program.\nIf Word launches successfully in Safe Mode, it’s likely that one of your plugins or Add-Ins is causing the crash.\nStep 2: Check for Problematic Add-Ins\nAdd-Ins can occasionally interfere with Word’s functionality. To identify and disable problematic Add-Ins:\nClick\nFile\n>\nOptions\n>\nAdd-Ins\n.\nIn the \"Manage\" dropdown at the bottom of the window, select\nCOM Add-Ins\nand click\nGo\n.\nDisable the Add-Ins one by one by unchecking their boxes. Each time, restart Word to see if the crash persists.\nIf disabling an Add-In resolves the problem, you’ve found the culprit! You can keep it disabled or check for updates from the Add-In’s developer.\nStep 3: Repair Microsoft Office\nIf Add-Ins aren’t to blame, the next step is repairing your Microsoft Office installation. This helps fix issues caused by corrupted files or missing components. Here’s how to do it:\nOpen Settings\n: On your Windows device, Right click\nStart\n, then select\nSettings\n.\nAccess Installed Apps\n: Navigate to\nApps\n>\nInstalled apps\n(or\nPrograms and Features\non older versions of Windows).\nFind Office\n: Locate your Microsoft Office installation in the list and click the 3 dots on the right side.\nChoose Modify\n: Select the\nModify\noption.\nSelect Repair Method\n: You’ll be prompted to choose a repair method:\nQuick Repair\n: Fixes most issues quickly without requiring an internet connection.\nOnline Repair\n: Performs a more thorough repair but requires internet access.\nFollow the Instructions\n: Select your preferred repair option and follow the on-screen steps.\nAfter completing the repair, try reopening Word. With any luck, it’ll be back to running smoothly!\nNeed Additional Help?\nIf these steps don’t resolve the issue, don’t hesitate to reach out for professional support.

I am currently working on my thesis, but every time I try to open my Word document, the application crashes. However, when I open the document in Word Online, I have no issues. Therefore, it shouldn't be a compatibility issue with my document. Additionally, when I open Word, it shows an incorrect character count of approximately 1.920.586 characters, which doesn't make sense since the whole document only has 15,000 words.

Here's How to Fix It\nClose\nClose\nBy\nZainab Falak\nPublished\nOct 21, 2022, 11:15 AM EDT\nZainab Falak is a seasoned technical writer, who has been creating troubleshooting guides and how-to articles for Microsoft Windows since 2019. Her expertise lies in creating concise and effective guides for common Windows errors, helping readers optimize their Windows devices. She likes to stay up-to-date with the latest Windows updates and technologies to provide the most accurate information possible.\nSign in to your\nMUO\naccount\nIf you use Microsoft Word to create and edit documents on a daily basis, experiencing issues with it can cost you both your time and effort. You might also end up losing a lot of work at a time!\nA common problem recently faced by users is that Microsoft Word frequently crashes on their Windows PC. The problem has been reported by both Windows 10 and Windows 11 users. In this guide, we will take a look at why Word crashes and the solution to try to prevent that from happening.\nWhat Causes Word to Crash on Windows?\nBefore we get into fixing the error, it is important to understand why the error occurs in the first place. In most cases, the crash is accompanied by an error code that states:\nWe're sorry, but Word has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. Word will need to be closed as a result. Would you like us to repair now?\nWhen the users click on the Repair button, Word closes automatically without starting the repair process. We had a look into this issue and discovered that this issue is commonly caused by the following few reasons:\nWord is not up-to-date. Outdated apps can deal with several issues like compatibility problems and corruption errors that prevent you from running them properly. If this happens, the best way to fix the problem is by installing the pending updates.\nThe Word file you are trying to launch is corrupt. In some cases, it can also be because of corrupt Word cache files.\nAn installed add-in is interrupting Word’s processes. If you have installed external add-ins, then you can try disabling or removing them to see if that fixes the problem.\nNow that you know about the potential causes of the error, you can proceed with the relevant solutions. However, before you get started with the troubleshooting methods, we suggest you restart your computer.\nThere are times when a temporary glitch in the system is causing apps like Word to crash. If this is the case in your situation, rebooting should fix the problem without having to go through any troubleshooting!\n1. Disable Any Active Add-ins\nAdd-ins allow you to extend the functionality of your program by adding new features and commands. While typically, they work fine in the background, they also have a bad reputation for interrupting the app’s processes and causing issues like the one at hand.\nIf this scenario is applicable, then you can try disabling the add-ins in Word and check if that fixes the problem for you. If it does, you can remove the problematic add-in to prevent issues like this from occurring in the future.\nHere is how you can do that:\nLaunch Word and click on the\nFile\noption in the top-left corner.\nScreenshot by Zainab Falak\nChoose\nOptions\nfrom the left pane.\nScreenshot by Zainab Falak\nIn the following dialog, click on\nAdd-ins\n.\nScreenshot by Zainab Falak\nMove to the right side of the window and click on the\nGo button\nassociated with Manage at the bottom.\nScreenshot by Zainab Falak\nNow, uncheck the boxes associated with all the add-ins and click\nOK\n.\nScreenshot by Zainab Falak\nOnce done, close Word and perform a reboot.\nUpon reboot, hopefully, you will be able to use Word without any problems.\n2. Update Microsoft Office\nIf you have an outdated Office suite, it can cause Office apps to crash. In this circumstance, updating the Microsoft Office application is the best course of action.\nHere is how you can update Microsoft Office on your computer:\nLaunch any Microsoft Office application (like Word or Excel).\nHead to the\nFile\noption in the top-left corner.\nChoose\nAccounts\nfrom the left pane in the following window.\nScreenshot by Zainab Falak\nMove to the right side of the window and expand the dropdown for\nUpdate Options\nin the Manage Account section.\nScreenshot by Zainab Falak\nChoose\nUpdate now\nfrom the list of options available. With this, Office will start looking for updates and downloading them.\nScreenshot by Zainab Falak\nWait for the updates to install, and then check if you can use Microsoft Word without any problems.\nWhile you are at it, we also recommend checking if your Windows is up-to-date; it's a\ngood Windows-related habit to cultivate\n. Downloading the latest version of Windows may also help fix your Word woes.\n3. Repair Office\nAnother way to fix problems with Microsoft Office applications is by repairing the Office suite. Microsoft Office offers two forms of built-in repairs; Quick repair and Online repair.\nIt is a good idea to start with a Quick repair. If that does not fix the problem, you can proceed with the Online repair option. However, these options are available to users using the Office suite. If you are an Office 365 user, you will only be presented with the Quick repair option.\nMUO Report: Subscribe and never miss what matters\nStay updated with the latest tech trends, expert tips, and product reviews in the world of technology with MUO's Newsletters.\nSubscribe\nBy subscribing, you agree to receive newsletter and marketing emails, and accept our\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.

Locate Microsoft Office and choose\nChange\nfrom the context menu.\nScreenshot by Zainab Falak\nClick\nYes\nin the User Account Control prompt.\nIf your copy of Office is MSI-based, you will be redirected to the Change your installation window. There, choose\nRepair\nand click on the\nContinue\nbutton.\nIf the system finds issues, it will notify you or attempt to repair them automatically.\nIf you are using a \"Click-to-run\" copy of Office, choose Quick repair and click on the\nRepair\nbutton in the same dialog.\nScreenshot by Zainab Falak\nWait for the process to complete and check if you can now use Microsoft Word. If the issue persists, you can proceed with performing an Online repair.\nYou can also consider reinstalling Word if nothing else helps.\nMicrosoft Word's Crashing Issue, Resolved\nThere is nothing more frustrating than an app like Microsoft Word crashing while you're typing away or editing a document. It does not just waste your time, but can also make you lose your important work.\nWe hope that the methods listed above help you figure out the cause of the problem and fix it instantly.

Whenever he tries to edit one of his existing Word docs Word crashes. If I check the event viewer I can see that mscss7qe.dll is the cause. I can’t find this dll anywhere. It looks like one of the language pack dlls but there is no language that I can find that qe would refer too, besides which all extant language packs in office and their corresponding dlls are accounted for.\nI’ve tried updating office to the latest and this stopped a similar event being caused by the Italian language pack but this qe one persists.\n7 Spice ups\nSamael1\n(Samael1)\nSeptember 26, 2024, 10:21am\n2\nHave you tried opening word in safe mode then opening the word document that is having the issue?\nWill it open in Word online?

I’ve had very good luck with the Quick repair.

Their “remedy” is to remove extraneous language packs.  :humph:\nmscss7ge.dll is from the German language pack.\nDefinitely run SFC.\nalexfogerty\n(Alex Fogerty)\nSeptember 29, 2024,  7:37pm\n8\nIf it is just one file then open Word in Safe Mode and save the file again, which should fix the issue.\nIf it is multiple files, then uninstall and reinstall Office 365.\n1 Spice up\nmikehu0305\n(mikehu0305)\nSeptember 30, 2024,  9:17am\n9\nIt sounds like you’re dealing with a tricky issue! The\nmscss7qe.dll\nfile causing Word to crash is indeed unusual. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this problem:\nSafe Mode\n:\nTry opening Word in Safe Mode to see if the issue persists. This can help determine if the problem is caused by add-ins or extensions.\nPress `Win + R`, type `winword /safe`, and press Enter.\nRepair Office Installation\n:\nUse the built-in repair tool to repair your Office installation.\nGo to\nControl Panel > Programs > Programs and Features\n.\nRight-click on Microsoft Office and select\nChange\n.\nChoose the\nQuick Repair\noption first. If that doesn’t work, try the\nOnline Repair\noption.\nCheck for Add-ins\n:\nDisable any add-ins that might be causing the issue.\nOpen Word, go to\nFile > Options > Add-ins\n.\nAt the bottom of the window, select\nCOM Add-ins\nand click\nGo\n.\nUncheck all add-ins and restart Word to see if the issue is resolved.\nUpdate Office\n:\nEnsure that Office is fully updated. Sometimes, updates can fix bugs and compatibility issues.\nOpen any Office app, go to\nFile > Account > Update Options > Update Now\n.\nCheck for Corrupt Files\n:\nRun the System File Checker to check for and repair corrupt system files.\nOpen Command Prompt as an administrator and run `sfc /scannow`.\nReinstall Language Packs\n:\nSince the issue might be related to language packs, try reinstalling them.\nGo to\nControl Panel > Programs > Programs and Features\n.\nUninstall any language packs.\nReinstall the necessary language packs from the official Microsoft website.\nUse the SaRA Tool\n:\nMicrosoft Support and Recovery Assistant (SaRA) can help diagnose and fix issues with Office.\nDownload and run the SaRA tool from\nMicrosoft’s website\n.\nRelated

Given that you've already tried several troubleshooting steps, here are a few additional suggestions that might help resolve the problem:\nCheck for File Corruption:\nSince the files open fine on your PC but not on your phone, it's possible that the files might be slightly corrupted when handled by the mobile app. Try saving a new copy of the document on your PC and then opening that new version on your phone.\nInternet Connection:\nEnsure that your internet connection is stable. Sometimes, a poor connection can cause issues with syncing and opening files from cloud storage.\nSign Out and Sign Back In:\nTry signing out of the Word app on your phone, then sign back in. This can sometimes resolve issues related to authentication or syncing.\nCheck Storage Space:\nEnsure that your phone has sufficient storage space. Lack of storage can sometimes cause apps to malfunction.\nTest with Other Files:\nTry opening different Word files on your phone to see if the issue is specific to the files you're currently working on or if it's a broader problem with the app.\nOneDrive Sync Issues:\nThe problem you mentioned with OneNote not syncing might be related. If your files are stored in OneDrive, it’s possible that sync issues are affecting Word as well. Try accessing the files directly from the OneDrive app to see if there are any errors or issues there.\nCheck for System Updates:\nMake sure your Android system is fully updated. Sometimes, system updates can resolve compatibility issues with apps.\nContact Microsoft Support:\nIf none of the above steps work, it might be worth reaching out to Microsoft Support for further

If it's not there, reinstall it from the\nMicrosoft 365 portal\n.\n2. Set Word as the Default App\nRight-click the Word document and select\nOpen with > Choose another app\n.\nIf Word is not listed, click\nMore apps\n.\nScroll down and select\nLook for another app on this PC\n.\nNavigate to\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\OfficeXX\n(XX depends on your version).\nSelect\nWINWORD.EXE\nand check\nAlways use this app to open .docx files\n.\n3. Repair Microsoft 365\nGo to\nSettings > Apps > Installed Apps\n.\nSelect\nMicrosoft 365 > Modify > Quick Repair\n.\nIf the issue persists, try\nOnline Repair\n.\n4.

For example, in Microsoft Word, go to the Word menu. Then choose About Word.

You might consider using\nLibreOffice\nto replace Microsoft Office.\nLibreOffice\nis a free, somewhat compatible desktop suite. Microsoft has a free, on-line version of Microsoft Office at\nOneDrive.com\n, which is also a good substitute for users of older versions of Mac OS if you don’t mind the hassle of having to use the web.\nIf your version of Office is currently\n15\n.anything, follow these instructions to install Microsoft Office updates:\nDownload a copy of the current version of AutoUpdate from this link, install and then run AutoUpdate to bring your installation to current update level, then restart your Mac.

Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. We are happy to help you.\nAs per your description, please don’t worry, we can work together to narrow down and resolve the situation.\nSince you mention the problem happen to Word files on Mac OS.  As the problem can be caused by different reason, I will appreciate you can try the normal troubleshooting steps 1 by 1 below and tell us the result.\n1.First please try installing updates then test again.\nUpdate Office for Mac automatically - Office Support\n.\nThe latest updates version is 16.62\n2.Try to reboot Mac in safe mode and determine whether background programs are causing the issue. For detailed information, please check\nthis article\n.\n3.Have you ever installed any add-ins for Word? If so, please disable them and then check the outcomes.\n4.Another suggestion is to remove the Office folders from Containers folder in Library with following steps.\na: Completely quit all Office apps\nb: In Finder, press\nCOMMAND\n+\nShift\n+\ng\n.\nc: Enter**~/Library** and click Go\nd: Go to\nContainers\nfolder, find the folder called\nMicrosoft Word\nor com.Microsoft.Word\ne: Move this folder to your desktop by cut&paste .\nf: Relaunch Word for Mac application and see the results.\n5.Also, I suggest starting by checking file system using Disk Utility.

You can go to the Applications folder In Finder and drag Microsoft Word .app to the trash. Then Restart your Mac Download this installer\nInstall package\nand use it to reinstall Microsoft Word (the version 16.62). Then, restart your Mac and test.\nest.\nMeanwhile, as a temporary work around, you could work on your documents with\nWord Online\n, login with your Microsoft Account to continuous your work.\nIf above suggestion does not work, to narrow down your issue, please tell us more information below to let us help you:\nConfirm whether other applications also get the same problem?

Peters,\nThank you for posting here in Microsoft Community.\nI'm really sorry to hear you're having trouble with the Word app on your Samsung Galaxy Tab 7. That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially since it works just fine on your Lenovo phone. You've already taken some solid steps like reinstalling the app, clearing the cache, and restarting the tablet, so I completely understand how annoying it must be that it's still crashing when you try to type.\nLet’s work through this together and see if we can get it running smoothly again. Here's a refined set of troubleshooting steps that go a bit deeper:\nCheck for System Updates\nGo to\nSettings > Software update > Download and install\n.\nMake sure your tablet is running the latest version of Android and One UI.\nUpdate Microsoft Word\nOpen the\nGoogle Play Store\n, search for\nMicrosoft Word\n, and ensure it’s fully updated.\nCheck for App Conflicts\nBoot your tablet into\nSafe Mode\n:\nPress and hold the\nPower button\n.\nTap and hold\nPower off\nuntil you see\nSafe Mode\n.\nTap\nSafe Mode\nto restart.\nTry opening Word and typing. If it works fine, another app might be interfering.\nFree Up RAM and Storage\nGo to\nSettings > Battery and device care > Memory\nand clear background apps.\nEnsure you have at least\n1–2 GB of free RAM\nand\nsufficient storage\n.\nReset App Preferences\nGo to\nSettings > Apps > Tap the three dots (⋮) > Reset app preferences\n.\nThis won’t delete data but will reset permissions and defaults.\nTry

unable to access the Microsoft Word web app on their Samsung Fold 3 device, and instead is forced into the standalone Word app which lacks certain features. A workaround is provided to access the web app by requesting the desktop version of Office.com.","raw_content":"Reddit - The heart of the internet\nSkip to main content\nGo to SamsungDex\nr/SamsungDex\n•\nIndyHCKM\nMS Word Web App not loading on any browser I've tried\nEDIT: PROBLEM SOLVED - all I needed to do was request the desktop version of\nOffice.com\non my web browser.  Once I did that, I got the normal looking web app that I could access on any desktop computer.  This feels really, really great!  Special thanks to\nu/cjwalkerman\nfor pointing me in the right direction!\n__________________\nI've read that the web app for Microsoft Word is a better experience than the Word app (or, I guess, also the 365 Co-Pilot app?).\nBut I've tried all sorts of browsers (Edge, Brave, Firefox, Vivaldi, Chrome, Kiwi) and none allow me to access the web app.  They will show a preview of the document and when I click the little pencil on the top right to edit, it forces me into the Word app.  This is true whether I'm in Dex or regular mode.  I'm on a Fold 3.\nDoes anybody know a work around to this?  The Word App on Dex doesn't show me the margin ruler nor does it show page numbers.  I'd really like to see if the web app is better.\nI've also checked my 365 subscription to make sure I have access to both web and mobile apps.  I do.  I've also tried deleting all of the MS apps on my phone and see if that will force the web app to function.

Is the license for the Laptop specific to just that machine?\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Word | For home | Android\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Word | For home | Android\nA family of Microsoft word processing software products for creating web, email, and print documents.\nSign in to follow\nLocked Question.\nThis question was migrated from the Microsoft Support Community.

Microsoft 365 Basic does offer web-based versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, which you should be able to use in your browser on the tablet. Have you tried accessing Word online through a web browser instead of the app?\nIt’s not quite the same experience as the full desktop version, but it might still meet your needs without an extra subscription cost.\nBest Regards,\nLonex P.\nMicrosoft Moderator\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2025-05-27T15:30:15+00:00\nMy subscription is just for the Microsoft 365 Basic Version in which case I've concluded my Samsung Tablet is not allowed access to Word without paying an additional exorbidant monthly fee, which for me just would not be worth the cost. In which case I am limited in my use of Word to my Laptop, which functions on the Bsic Subscription.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2025-05-26T14:22:21+00:00\nHi LeonardSeales\nWe have noticed that you have not replied to our last response.

The Microsoft 365 subscription is tied to your Microsoft account, not to a specific device. It seems like there might be an issue with the licensing on your tablet.  Here are some steps you can try:\nCheck Your Microsoft 365 Subscription\n– Sometimes, certain apps may require a different licensing model. You can verify your subscription status by signing into Microsoft Account Services to ensure Word is included.\nDevice-Specific Licensing\n– Microsoft 365 licenses can sometimes be tied to specific devices, especially if your subscription was activated on your laptop first. Try signing out of your Microsoft account on the tablet and signing back in.\nApp Cache and Data Issues\n– Clearing the cache and data for the Word app might resolve the issue. Go to Settings > Apps > Word > Storage & Cache, then select Clear Storage.\nPending Updates\n– Ensure that all Microsoft Office apps are updated via the Google Play Store.

Yes, I could use the web-based version but it doesn't do all of the same functions and I need to do a lot of editing/formatting, etc so I desperately need this bloody app to work.

That's quite a few!\nThe sample report suggests Word is having trouble displaying its window. You've already reinstalled Word, so chances are the installation is fine.\nMay I make some assumptions? The problem did not exist until you installed the 15.2 update of Sequoia, is that correct?\nBob suggested that you reinstall Sequoia, but I will make an additional suggestion that you verify your startup volume.\nHow to repair a Mac disk with Disk Utility -\nAnother possible thing to check is perhaps there is a problem in your current Mac OS user account.

What is clear is that it is a\nsystem generated\nerror report, not one generated by the Microsoft Error Reporting Program [MERP]. The suggested cause is a failure in the file management service of the OS.\nIt would be best to get support from Apple although you might try this routine first:\nHow to reinstall macOS - Apple Support\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2024-12-27T16:28:22+00:00\nPlease find the error report that keeps coming up\nHERE.\nI have tried everything you suggested with no luck.\nCheers,\nClare\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2024-12-27T16:14:00+00:00\nDear Clare R MBA,\nGood day to you!\nI hope you are doing well. Thanks for reaching out to our Microsoft Community Forum. We will be happy to help you.\nI’m sorry to hear that you’re experiencing issues with the Word app crashing on your Mac. Based on your description, I suggest trying the following steps to resolve the problem:\nStart in Safe Mode\n:\nShut down your Mac.\nPress and hold the power button to turn it on.\nWhen you see the startup options, release the power button.\nSelect your startup disk.\nPress and hold the\nShift\nkey, then click “Continue in Safe Mode.”\nOnce you reach the login window, you may see “Safe Boot” in the top right corner.\nClear Word Cache\n:\nThe local cache files for Word are stored in ~/Library/Containers/Microsoft Word.\nImportant\n: Before clearing the cache, please back up your files to another location to avoid data loss.\nDrag the Office folder to your desktop. Check the issue persists.\nMeanwhile, to better understand your situation, could you provide the following information?\nA screenshot of your Office application version:\nOpen Word, click on\nWord\nin the top menu, and select “About Microsoft Word.”\nAre you experiencing similar issues with other Office applications such as Excel or PowerPoint?\nAre you experiencing issue with a particular file or every word file?\nI would like to share that my first response may not resolve your current situation immediately.

I have summarized a few key suggestions from official sources for you to try:\n1) Test with a Local Copy (Important for Shared Docs)\nSince you mentioned this is a\nshared document\n, performance issues can happen if Word is struggling to sync changes in real-time.\nTry\ndownloading\nthe file to your Mac (e.g., Desktop or Downloads folder).\nOpen the local copy.\nResult:\nIf the local copy works fine without crashing, the issue is likely related to the network connection or OneDrive sync, rather than the Word application itself.\nYou can refer to a similar issue discussed in this thread:\nOffice apps on macOS become unresponsive when open\n2) Official Troubleshooting Steps\nIf the issue is not related to the file location (OneDrive), Microsoft has a dedicated article with detailed steps to troubleshoot this specific symptom. I recommend following the instructions provided here:\nWord for Mac document stops responding when you try to open a document\n3) Clear Word Cache on Mac\nAdditionally, you can try clearing the Word cache, which often resolves unexpected crashes:\nQuit Word completely.\nOpen\nFinder\n> Press\nCommand + Shift + G\n.\nPaste this path:\n~/Library/Containers\nFind the folder named\nMicrosoft Word\n(or\ncom.microsoft.Word\n).\nMove this folder to your Desktop (as a backup) and restart Word.\nReference:\nClear the Office cache\nIf the issue persists or if you face any difficulties with these suggestions, please feel free to post back here so we can assist you further.\nIf the answer is helpful, please click\n\"Accept Answer\"\nand kindly upvote it.

The file does open when it is downloaded to my desktop, suggesting it is a OneDrive issue. Is there a way I can fix this?\nI am not sure the relevancy of this, but the group project are all editing this document at the same time so when it crashes we lose all of our combined work.\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nKudos-Ng\n•\n13,760\nReputation points\n•\nMicrosoft External Staff\n•\nModerator\n2026-02-10T14:54:48.23+00:00\nHi\nKatharine Smith (Medicine Clinical)\n,\nThank you for the quick update and for testing the previous suggestions.\nBased on your description that the combined work from your group seems to be lost, it is highly likely that this issue is related to a file syncing problem with OneDrive on your Mac. When the sync client gets stuck or fails, changes made locally might not upload, and vice versa, potentially causing Word to hang when trying to reconcile the versions.\n1) Immediate File Recovery\nBefore troubleshooting the app, let's try to find your missing work:\nCheck Online Version History:\nSign in to OneDrive on the web browser, locate the affected file, and check whether the changes appear there. If not, open the file in Word Online, go to\nFile > Info > Version History\n, and review whether any version was uploaded but not synced back to the desktop app.\nCheck Recycle Bins:\nIf the file is missing or reverted, check the OneDrive Recycle Bin and the Second-stage Recycle Bin on the web.\nReference:\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/restore-deleted-files-or-folders-in-onedrive-949ada80-00…\nNote:\nIf you find the latest version of your group's work, please Download it immediately and save it to a safe local folder (not in OneDrive) as a backup.\n2) Troubleshoot OneDrive Sync\nIt sounds like your OneDrive client might be in a \"bad state\" where files are stuck in \"sync pending\" or show inconsistent status. There is a symptom that can cause Office apps to freeze. Please refer to the troubleshooting steps in this thread:\nOneDrive for Mac syncing issue - Microsoft Q&A\n3) Verify with a New File\nOnce OneDrive is syncing correctly (or even while testing), try creating a\nnew blank shared document\nand see if Word still crashes when opening it. This will verify if the crash is specific to the corrupted original file or the Word application itself.\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nKudos-Ng\n•\n13,760\nReputation points\n•\nMicrosoft External Staff\n•\nModerator\n2026-02-11T09:36:17.35+00:00\nHi\nKatharine Smith (Medicine Clinical)\n,\nJust checking in to see if you had a chance to review the previous response.\nYour feedback would be very helpful in ensuring everything is on track.\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nKatharine Smith (Medicine Clinical)\n•\n0\nReputation points\n2026-02-12T10:44:01.99+00:00\nHi, the most recent version that saves is never my recent work, it tends to be from the night before.

Losing recent work is incredibly frustrating.\nSince the newest version online is from the night before, it likely means your latest edits didn’t finish syncing to OneDrive.\n1) Before changing anything, try to recover your newest work\nCheck Word AutoRecover on your Mac (this may contain the latest edits after a crash):\nIn Finder, select\nGo > Go to Folder…\n(or press\nShift + Command + G\n)\nPaste this path and press Enter:\n/Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.Microsoft/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery\n(Replace\n<username>\nwith your Mac username.)\nIf you find a newer recovered file, open it and save it immediately to Desktop.\nThen go to OneDrive online to confirm whether your other files/folder changes are fully synced (and check Version History if available).\n2) Fix OneDrive syncing\nPause & Resume Sync:\nOneDrive cloud icon (menu bar) >\nPause syncing\n>\nResume syncing\nUnlink & Relink:\nOneDrive\nPreferences\n>\nAccount\n>\nUnlink this Mac\n, then sign in again.\nReset OneDrive (if still stuck):\nQuit OneDrive > open Finder > Applications > OneDrive >\nShow Package Contents\n> Contents > Resources > run\nResetOneDriveApp.command\n(or\nResetOneDriveAppStandalone.command\n). Then reopen OneDrive and sign in. (Resetting doesn’t delete your files, but it resets settings and forces a full resync.)\nTip to avoid this in the future with shared documents\nShared documents can be more prone to sync conflicts if OneDrive is unstable. For group editing, consider using\nWord Online\nfor the shared session, or keep a quick local backup copy before closing Word completely.\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nSign in to comment\nAdd comment\nQ&A Assist\n2026-02-10T10:40:28.58+00:00\nAI generated content.\nThis question contains an answer created with AI from Q&A Assist.\nLearn more\nIf Microsoft Word is crashing or not opening files on your MacBook, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:\nCheck for Software Issues\n: Ensure that the problem is not related to the document itself. Try opening other Word documents to see if they also cause issues. If other documents open without problems, the issue may be with the specific file.\nRepair Office Installation\n: Since you're experiencing crashes, consider performing a full repair of your Office installation. You can do this by going to the Settings App, selecting Apps, finding Microsoft Office, and choosing to modify it with an Online Repair.\nRename Normal.dotm\n: Sometimes, issues can arise from the default template. You can try renaming the Normal.dotm file. Search for it in your system (typically found in\n%userprofile%\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\templates\n), right-click it, and rename it to something like \"Oldword.old\". Then restart Word and try opening your document again.\nStart Word with Default Settings\n: You can start Word using the\n/a\nswitch to load it with default settings, which may help in resolving the issue. To do this, exit Word, open the Run dialog, and type\nwinword.exe /a\n.\nCheck for Updates\n: Make sure that your Microsoft Office is up to date. Sometimes, updates can fix bugs that cause crashes.\nUninstall and Reinstall Office\n: If none of the above steps work, you may need to completely uninstall Office, restart your MacBook, and then reinstall Office from your Microsoft account.\nThese steps should help you troubleshoot the issue with Microsoft Word on your MacBook.\nReferences:\nHow to fix my MS Word? - Microsoft Q&A\nwe are sorry, but word has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly.

In this forum, we are  Microsoft consumers just like yourself.\nHere's a troubleshooting guide to help you:\nUpdate the App: Make sure you have the latest version of the Word app installed on your iPhone. Developers often release updates to fix bugs and improve stability.\nRestart Your iPhone: Sometimes, simply restarting your device can resolve app crashes. Press and hold the power button until the \"slide to power off\" slider appears. Turn off your device, then turn it back on.\nClear App Cache: Clearing the app cache can help resolve some issues. To do this, go to \"Settings\" > \"General\" > \"iPhone Storage.\" Find Microsoft Word in the list of apps, tap it, and then tap \"Offload App.\" This will remove the app but keep your documents intact. Afterward, reinstall Word from the App Store.\nCheck for Software Updates: Ensure your iOS is up to date. Go to \"Settings\" > \"General\" > \"Software Update\" to check for and install any available updates.\nReset Word Preferences: If you're using Word through the Office app, try resetting the app preferences. Go to \"Settings\" > \"Office\" > \"Reset\" and choose \"Reset All Settings.\"\nFree Up Space: Ensure you have enough free storage space on your iPhone. Running low on storage can cause apps to crash.\nCheck for Conflict with Other Apps: Sometimes, other apps can conflict with Word.

Patrick. Thanks for the details.\nIs your Word app updated?\nCrashes on save are often caused by bugs that are fixed in updates.\nUpdate Word:\nOpen Word > Help > Check for Updates\nOr use Microsoft AutoUpdate from\n/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/MAU2.0/Microsoft AutoUpdate.app\nUpdate macOS:\nGo to Apple menu > System Settings > General > Software Update  After updating, restart your Mac and try saving again.\nSee if this helps. If you need further assistance, just let me know.\nBest regards,\nKimberly\n1 comment\nShow comments for this answer\nReport a concern\nPatrick Johnson\n•\n0\nReputation

It’s important to solve this problem as soon as possible.\nHere are the most common fixes:\nCheck the name of the hard drive\nClear the auto-recovery folder\nReset preferences and restart your Mac\nSave the Word document elsewhere\nCheck Word updates\nCreate a new account\nCheck for Add-ins and disable them\nClear Word application cache\nEnter safe mode on your Mac\nStart Disk Utility on your Mac\nReinstall Microsoft Office for Mac\n1. Check the name of the hard drive\nWeirdly, the name of your Mac’s hard drive can cause issues with Microsoft Word, including random crashes.\nHere’s how to check your hard drive’s name:\nOpen\nDisk Utility\nfrom\nApplications > Utilities\n.\nSelect your system disk from the sidebar, and check its name starts with a letter, rather than a number. It also shouldn’t contain any special characters.\nStep 1. Open Disk Utility\nStep 2. Check your disk name\n2. Clear the auto-recovery folder\nThere’s a folder on your Mac that contains all the automatically saved documents that can accumulate over time and cause Microsoft Word not working on Mac.\nClearing out that folder may solve the problem:\nOpen\nFinder\nand select\nGo > Go to Folder\nin the top menu bar.\nType or paste in\n~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery\nand hit\nReturn\n.\nDelete the contents of the\nAutoRecovery\nfolder.\nStep 1. Select Go to Folder\nStep 2. Go to the AutoRecovery folder\nStep 3. Delete the AutoRecovery folder\n3. Reset Word preferences and restart Mac\nYour Mac stores all kinds of settings for your apps, including Word. Resetting these preferences to default settings can help when Word keeps closing by itself.\nHere’s how:\nIn\nWord\n, select\nWord > Preferences\nfrom the menu bar.\nClick\nFile Locations\n.\nSelect\nUser Templates\nfrom the list, then click\nReset\n. Restart your Mac.\nStep 1. Open Word's preferences\nStep 2. Click File Locations\nStep 3. Select user templates and click Reset\n4. Save the Word document elsewhere\nWhere you’ve saved your Word file could be the reason for crashing issues. Perhaps the folder you’ve stored the file in has the wrong permissions, or maybe you’ve saved your file to an external drive that’s failing.\nSave your document somewhere else like this:\nOpen your\nWord document\n, and select\nFile > Save As\nfrom your menu bar.\nSelect a new location, and click\nSave\n.\nStep 1. Select Save As\nStep 2. Choose a new location for your file\n5. Check Word updates\nIt’s common to experience issues with outdated software, but it’s especially critical with Office programs for macOS.\nMicrosoft autoupdate on Mac\nshould handle this, but\nfollow these steps to make sure you’re using the latest version of Word available for your Mac:\nIn\nWord\n, select\nHelp > Check for updates\nin the menu bar.\nClick\nCheck for updates\n.\nClick the\narrow\nto see more details.\nStep 1. Select Check for updates\nStep 2. Click the Check for updates button\nStep 3. See which updates are available\n6. Create a new account\nSpecifically, you should try creating a new macOS user account.

Click\nAdd User\n.\nEnter your password and click\nUnlock\n.\nEnter the details for your new user, and click\nCreate User\n. Log into this new account and try Word again.\nStep 1. Open Users & Groups and add a user\nStep 2. Enter your details\nStep 3. Set up your new user\n7. Check for Add-ins and disable them\nSometimes third-party add-ins can interfere with Word and cause it to quit unexpectedly. We've noticed that disabling them will help determine if the issue originates from external extensions rather than Word itself.\nFollow these steps:\nOpen Word and select\nTools > Templates and Add-ins.\nUntick\nall the\nadd-ins listed.\nRestart Word and check\nif it runs without issues.\nIf Word works fine,\nenable the add-ins\none by one to find the faulty one.\nStep 1. Open Word and select Tools > Templates and Add-ins\nStep 2. If there’s anything to turn off, untick all the add-ins listed\n8. Clear Word application cache\nWord stores cache data to improve performance, but sometimes these files become corrupted, triggering crashes. Our team points out that clearing the Word cache provides a fresh start without deleting your documents or preferences.\nHere's how to reset it:\nClose Microsoft Word\ncompletely.\nOpen\nFinder\nand click\nGo > Go to Folder\nin the top menu.\nType\n~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Caches\n/ and press\nReturn\n.\nDelete the cache files\ninside this folder.\nRestart Word\nand see if the crashes stop.\nStep 1.

Delete the cache files inside this folder\n9. Enter safe mode on your Mac\nThis is a classic way to troubleshoot problems with macOS. Safe mode boots up your Mac only with the software and drivers that come with the operating system. If Word stops crashing in safe mode, then the issue is likely caused by a third-party driver.\nBoot an Apple Silicon Mac into safe mode like this:\nShut down your Mac.\nPress and hold\npower\nuntil you see\nLoading startup options.\nChoose a volume.\nPress and hold the\nShift\nkey, then\nContinue in Safe Mode\n.\nOn an Intel Mac, get into a safe mode like this:\nTurn on or restart your Mac, and immediately press and hold\nShift\n.\nWhen you see the login window, release\nShift\n.\nLog into your Mac. Log in again, if you’re prompted to.\n10. Start Disk Utility on your Mac\nIt’s possible more fundamental problems relating to your internal disk are why Word keeps quitting.\nRunning the First Aid function in Disk Utility can help:\nPress\nControl+Space\nto open\nSpotlight\nand search for\nDisk Utility\nto open it. Choose your drive from the sidebar. Click\nFirst Aid\n.\nClick\nRun\n.\nClick\nContinue\n, and let the process run.\nStep 1. Click the First Aid button\nStep 2. Click the Run button\nStep 3. Click Continue\n11. Reinstall Microsoft Office for Mac\nThis is the last resort that is likely to work if your previous installation of Word didn’t go the way it was supposed to.\nGo through these steps to reinstall Word on Mac:\nQuit all the Microsoft Office apps that you’re currently running.\nOpen the\nApplications\nfolder in\nFinder\n, and send every Microsoft Office app to the\nTrash\n.\nGo to the App Store and reinstall the suite.\nStep 1. Quit all your Microsoft apps\nStep 2. Move your Microsoft apps to Trash\nStep 3. Install your apps again\nHow to recover damaged and unsaved Word documents on Mac\nWord’s auto-save function only kicks in when you’ve saved a file manually at least once. However,\nif your Word file was never saved or if it’s damaged, you might still be able to recover it, like this:\nSelect the target location\nSearch for lost files\nRecover Word files\n1. Select the target location\nWord has an AutoRecover function, which may help you get back unsaved data if the app crashes.\nCheck in this AutoRecover folder on your Mac for recovered files like this:\nIn\nFinder\n, select\nGo > Go to Folder\nin the menu bar. Type\n~/Library/Containers/com.Microsoft/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery\nand press\nReturn\n.\nCheck the\nAutoRecovery\nfolder for files and try to open them.\n2.

Keep macOS and all your third-party apps up to date, because incompatibilities can cause crashes.\nClose unneeded apps:\nRunning lots of apps at once can eat into your system’s RAM and tie up your processor, which may cause Word to close itself.\nCheck your Microsoft licenses:\nAre you using an authentic copy of Word? If you’ve bought a fake license, it could cause issues with your software’s performance. You should also check your license if you get a warning saying\nyour account doesn’t allow editing on a Mac\n.\nOther fixes for common Word on Mac issues\nAside from Word quitting by itself, you might also experience other issues with Microsoft’s popular word processor.

Type\n~/Library/Preferences\n, and press\nReturn\n.\nDelete the\ncom.microsoft.Word.plist\nand\ncom.microsoft.office.plist\nfiles if you see them. Restart Word.\nStep 1. Go to your Mac's Preferences folder\nStep 2. Delete anything related to Word\n4. Microsoft Word slow on Mac\nVarious factors can cause Microsoft's performance to become laggy.\nThis checklist of potential slowdown fixes may help:\nTurn off the spell checker\nDisable your firewall\nClose demanding background processes\nTurn off the spell checker\nWhen this is turned on, Word will constantly check your content for potential spelling and grammar errors. This may cause the software to lag, particularly with larger files.\nLuckily, you can turn it off:\nOpen Word’s preferences from the menu bar, under\nWord > Preferences\n. Select\nSpelling & Grammar.\nUntick\nCheck spelling as you type\n. Close the preferences pane.\nStep 1. Open Spelling & Grammar settings\nStep 2. Turn off auto spell checking\nDisable your firewall\nWhen Office attempts to connect to the internet upon startup, firewalls can block this connection, causing the program to work slowly.\nAlthough this isn’t a good long-term solution, you can temporarily disable the macOS firewall:\nOpen\nSystem Settings\n, and select\nNetwork\nfrom the sidebar menu. Click\nFirewall\n.\nUse the switch to toggle the firewall off.\nStep 1. Go to your Mac's network settings\nStep 2. Turn off the firewall\nClose demanding background processes\nYour Mac may be running all kinds of apps and processes in the background. If any of these are taking a toll on your processor or RAM, then you might find they affect the performance of Microsoft Word.\nCheck for these processes and close them:\nPress\nCmd+Space\nto open\nSpotlight\n, then search for and open\nActivity Monitor\n.\nIn the\nCPU\nsection, click the\n% CPU\ncolumn to sort it by CPU usage.\nTo close a process, double-click it, then click the\nQuit\nbutton.\nStep 1. Open Activity Monitor\nStep 2. Go to the CPU section\nStep 3. Quit processes to save on system resources\nAlternatives to Microsoft Word for Mac\nAlthough Word is popular, it’s not the only word processor around. There are many alternatives for Mac, and practically all of them are compatible with Microsoft Word files.\nShould you continue having issues with Word closing down unexpectedly, here are just a few alternatives you can try:\nPages\n: Available on macOS and iOS, Pages is Apple’s free word processor. It has the company’s design ethos stamped all over it, with a simple, intuitive interface and more of a visual focus than Word.\nApache OpenOffice\n: This free app is one of several office apps that branched off from the now discontinued OpenOffice.org. It’s completely free and open source.\nLibreOffice\n: Another open-source office suite based on OpenOffice.org. Try it out if you’re having issues with Microsoft Word.\nGoogle Docs\n: Google’s cloud-based word processor works inside your web browser. It’s nowhere near as feature-rich as Microsoft Word, but it has one big advantage—cloud storage and auto-saving by default. As soon as you start typing, Google Docs saves your file to your account, and you can access it from anywhere with an internet connection.\nMicrosoft 365\n: Probably the best alternative to Microsoft Word is… Microsoft Word—specifically the cloud-based version. This gives you a lot of the Word features you’re used to, but with the added benefits of cloud computing. There are paid subscriptions, but you can also get free Microsoft Word for Mac.\nApple's Pages app\nApache OpenOffice\nLibreOffice\nGoogle Docs\nMicrosoft 365\nSay goodbye to issues with Microsoft Word\nIf you’re like a lot of computer users, then you rely on Microsoft’s tools practically every day. When Word keeps closing by itself, it can quickly become frustrating and a huge waste of time. We’ve looked at multiple solutions to this issue here, and hopefully one of them works for you, so you don’t keep losing your work.\nWhenever you’re troubleshooting such issues, though, we recommend giving\nMacKeeper\na try. Its\nSafe Cleanup\ntool can clear your Mac of junk files and other unneeded data in a matter of moments.

If yes,\nupdate Microsoft Office to the latest version\n.\nAfter updating Office, check if you can save your document or not.\n2] Save your Word document to another location\nBy default, the save location of Microsoft Office applications, like Word, Excel, etc., is the Documents folder.

Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot this issue:\nCheck Your Subscription:\nVerify that your Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) subscription is active.\nSign in to your Microsoft account at\nhttps://account.microsoft.com/services\nto check the status of your Word/Office subscription.\nSign In to Your Microsoft Account in Word:\nOpen Word and go to 'File' > 'Account'.\nSign out of any existing account and then sign back in with the account associated with your Microsoft 365 subscription.\nRun Office as Administrator:\nRight-click the Word shortcut and select 'Run as administrator'.\nOnce open, try activating it again within the application.\nRepair Office Installation:\nGo to 'Control Panel' > 'Programs' > 'Programs and Features'.\nFind Microsoft Office in the list, select it, and then click 'Change'.\nChoose either 'Quick Repair' or 'Online Repair' to repair your Office installation.\nUpdate Office:\nEnsure that you have the latest updates for Office. You can check for updates within any Office application by going to 'File' > 'Account' and clicking 'Update Options' > 'Update Now'.\nCheck for Multiple Versions:\nEnsure you don't have multiple versions of Office installed, as this can cause conflicts. Uninstall any older versions you no longer need.\nUse the Activation Troubleshooter:\nFor Windows 10 and later, you can use the Activation Troubleshooter found in the 'Update & Security' section of the Windows Settings.\nReset Office Activation State:\nOpen a command prompt as administrator.\nNavigate to the Office installation folder (usually C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office16).\nRun the following command: cscript ospp.vbs /rearm\nRestart your PC and try activating Office again.\nContact Microsoft Support:\nIf none of these steps work, contact Microsoft Support for further assistance.\nAs a precaution, make sure your PC's operating system is also up to date, as this can sometimes affect how applications run.

The combination might be odd as it involves the hashtag character in the file name and capitalization of the file's extension- but it exists and needs to be addressed regardless.\nAccording to Microsoft, this bug gets triggered when the .docx extension is capitalized with the hashtag symbol in its file name. Microsoft further adds a finding that the issue occurs after saving the file when prompted to click X to close the Word app. However, manually saving the file with '.DOCX' and a hashtag character in the file name does not reproduce the automatic deletion.\nThankfully, the deletion is not permanent, as the Recycle Bin can restore the file. Besides restoring it, Microsoft suggested two workarounds- save the file manually before closing Word, and another is to enable the option \"Don't show the Backstage when opening or saving files with keyboard shortcuts\" in Word.\nThe bug is specifically present with Microsoft 365 version 2409, as confirmed by Microsoft. It is peculiar that the bug only eats the Word document using .docx in all caps with a hashtag character in the file name. Microsoft didn't explain the cause of this bug specifically with this build, as it is still under investigation. No other combination has been discovered that reproduces auto-deletion yet.\nHaving a document deleted automatically is a nightmare, mainly when the application is used for many important work. It wouldn't be surprising to see users have a hashtag in the file name by someone whose profession is associated with social media, as the character is used for tagging in leading social media apps like Instagram and X, formerly Twitter. Users are likely unaware of this even if it goes to the Recycle Bin.\nTherefore, no matter how odd or seemingly rare, it is always best to kill the bug before it eats your homework.\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter\nGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.\nTOPICS\nSee all comments (1)\nRoshan Ashraf Shaikh\nContributing Writer\nRoshan Ashraf Shaikh has been in the Indian PC hardware community since the early 2000s and has been building PCs, contributing to many Indian tech forums, & blogs.

Here’s How to Fix It\nClose\nClose\nBy\nMaximilian Padilla-Rodriguez\nPublished\nOct 5, 2025, 1:00 PM EDT\nBorn and raised in Florida, Max is a longtime writer with experience covering topics ranging from obscure history, niche media, and (of course) tech advice. Currently, he is a contributing writer for How-To Geek, where he specializes Windows software and retro gaming hardware.\nMax previously contributed to\nStudy Breaks Magazine\nand\nCBR\n, where he wrote articles on both education and entertainment, though his favorite subjects have always involved gaming and computers.\nHe’s been playing video games and working on computers for longer than he can remember. Since he discovered his love for electronics, he has maintained a strong passion for video game and app preservation, and keeps a strong pulse on the tech industry.\nHaving earned a bachelor’s degree in English literature, Max has a habit of reading too deeply into minor details and obsessing over niche subjects. Most of his articles are an excuse to ramble about his latest obsessions, but sometimes he makes a good point or two. He also wrote a\nthesis paper\non the theological and historical influences behind Dante Alighieri’s\nDivine Comedy\n.\nIn his spare time, Max enjoys reading books from his ever-growing literary backlog, going for jogs, or training with his two German Shepherds.\nSign in to your\nHow-To Geek\naccount\nLike any other piece of software, Microsoft Word is prone to bugs and other technical issues. Usually, these issues are nothing more than minor inconveniences, but some of the more severe glitches can have terrifying consequences.\nImagine opening up an important document for work, only to find that all the text has been replaced by glitched letters and random symbols. That's unfortunately what happened to me, and it could happen to you, too! Thankfully, it's not as bad as it sounds, and you can easily fix this problem without losing any progress whatsoever.\nHow to Identify Microsoft Word's \"Corrupted Text\" Glitch\nBefore anything else, it's important to make sure that the problem you're encountering is related to Microsoft Word, and not the result of a broader issue affecting your device. The \"corrupted text\" glitch that I'll be discussing here will look something like this:\nYou might also see a mixture of normal text and glitched symbols, or have newly added text appear incorrectly. This glitch comes in varying degrees of severity, but the general idea is that your text won't appear with the proper characters. Although that may seem like a major issue, it's most likely just a visual bug—albeit, a very inconvenient one. In most cases, this problem can be solved in a few simple steps.\nSwap to a Different Font\nFor those of you in a hurry and looking for a temporary fix to ignore the problem, you can usually avoid this bug by simply swapping to\na different font\n. In my case, the bugged text only appeared when using the Aptos font, though you might encounter the same issue on a different font. If you need to change the font for a lengthy document, you can manually highlight the text or press CTRL+A to instantly select all text in the file, then choose a replacement font.\nHowever, I don't recommend leaving this glitch unresolved forever, as it can be the result of a bigger issue that will cause more bugs and potentially corrupt your Word document. While that's not always the case, it's better to be safe than sorry by trying any of the following permanent fixes.\nRe-install the Broken Font\nIf the glitched text only appears for one specific font, then the bug is related to the font itself. Either the font was improperly installed, or the Word app is unable to properly recognize the font. You can easily fix this problem by re-downloading the bugged font from its original source (just make sure it's from a trustworthy website).\nIf the bugged font is one of the standard fonts that came preloaded with Word, you can get them directly from Microsoft. For example, you can download Word's default Aptos font from\nthe Microsoft website\n.\nRegardless of whether you're downloading an official Microsoft font or a custom typeface, the installation process is exactly the same. After you download the \".zip\" file for the font, unzip the file by right-clicking it and selecting \"Extract All\" or using\na third-party app like 7-Zip\n. Next, select a folder in which to store the contents of the file.\nAfter you extract the contents of the \".zip\" file, open the destination folder. It should contain \".tff\" files labeled after different variants of the downloaded font. Find and open the file that corresponds with the bugged font.\nThis will open a new window containing a list of example sentences showcasing the font. Make sure you have selected the correct font, then click \"Install\" at the top of the window.\nOnce it has finished installing, all Word documents using the font should start to display the proper characters. If you still encounter the bug, the problem is likely related to the Word document itself or your current version of the Word app. In these cases, you'll need to try a different fix.\nUpdate Microsoft 365\nYou may encounter the corrupted text glitch if you're running an outdated version of Microsoft Word. You can fix this by running an update to Microsoft 365.\nStart by opening up the Word app and selecting \"Account\" on the home menu.\nFrom the account page, click \"Update Options.\" This will open a drop-down list. At the top of the list, click \"Update Now.\"\nMicrosoft 365 will begin checking for missing updates. If you have the latest version of Microsoft 365 installed, a pop-up will notify you that your apps are up-to-date. Otherwise, you'll see a different pop-up showing which apps need to be updated.\nBefore you continue, be sure to save any files you have opened in Word or other Microsoft 365 apps. Once you start the update, any currently open files will automatically close.\nOnce you've saved your documents, click \"Install\" to complete the download process.\nConvert the Document to a Different Character Encoding\nYou may encounter similar text issues when downloading or\nsharing Word documents with others\n. A document that appears perfectly fine on your computer may show up with corrupted text for someone else, and vice versa. In these cases, the cause of the bug is a character encoding error.\nWhat is Character Encoding?\nCharacter encoding\nrefers to the specific set of glyphs and symbols your computer uses to display text. For example, most of you reading this article are used to seeing the Latin alphabet (the letters used in English and many similar languages) when typing out a document or reading online articles. This is because most of your browsers and apps are set to a character encoding that primarily uses alphanumeric characters.\nTo put it simply, character encodings essentially serve as databases that dictate which characters the computer uses to display text. Every unique character is stored as a \"code point,\" each represented by a different integer. However, different character encodings don't always share the same exact characters or number of code points. For example, the character \"ё\" is recognized by the numeric value 184 in Windows-1251 encoding—which is primarily used for the Cyrillic scripts of languages like Russian and Ukranian. But in Unicode—the universal character encoding standard used for almost all modern websites and programs around the world—the character \"ё\" is represented by the numeric value 0401.\nWhenever you open a document or access a website, your computer interprets the code points first, then displays the corresponding characters based on its own encoding. However, if the original text was written for another character encoding that uses different code points, then the text may not appear correctly on your system.\nHow to Fix Character Encoding Problems in Word\nBy default, Word will processes text in UTF-8, a type of Unicode that's designed to be compatible with ASCII encoding. This normally isn't a problem, as UTF-8 supports characters and symbols from nearly every major language. However, if you were to convert text from another file type with a different encoding standard into a Word document, it may appear as a jumbled mess of characters.\nIn some cases, you can fix this issue by converting your Word document into another encoding. Open the document you want to convert, then click \"File.\" Go to \"Options\" at the bottom of the startup screen, then click on the \"Advanced\" tab.\nScroll down until you reach the \"General\" options, then check off the box labeled \"Confirm file format conversion on open.\"\nClick \"OK,\" then save and exit from the document. Open the Word File again, and you'll see a pop-up box labeled \"Convert File.\" From the list of options included in the box, select \"Encoded Text,\" then click \"OK.\"\nAnother dialogue box will appear. Select the bubble labeled \"Other encoding\" and choose the suitable character encoding from the list. If you aren't sure which one to choose, you can check the preview at the bottom of the pop-up box to see if a selected encoding repairs the text.\nIt should be noted that this process won't always result in a perfect conversion. Some characters may be lost when converting documents into other encodings. If you're working with a much more obscure encoding that Word isn't equipped to handle, you might not have the option to properly convert it into UTF-8, even with these steps. However, these scenarios are incredibly rare.\nDelete and Reinstall Microsoft Word\nIf nothing else works, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling Word. A faulty app installation or update error can cause unexpected bugs such as the corrupted text glitch.\nUninstalling Word\nThere are few ways to uninstall Word, depending on the app version you're using.\nHow-To Geek Report: Subscribe and never miss what matters\nUnlock your tech-savvy potential and master the digital world with How-To Geek.\nSubscribe\nBy subscribing, you agree to receive newsletter and marketing emails, and accept our\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n. You can unsubscribe anytime.\nIf you have a standalone version of Word, you can uninstall it by opening the control panel on your computer (if you don't know where to find it, type \"control panel\" into the Start Menu search bar), then click \"Uninstall a program.\"\nScroll through the list until you find Microsoft Word, then double-click it and select \"Yes\" in the following pop-up box. If you can't find Microsoft Word in this list, your version of Word might be part of a\nMicrosoft 365 bundle\n. In that case, scroll through the list until you find \"Microsoft 365,\" then double-click the app and select \"Yes\" when prompted to uninstall it.\nIf you somehow cannot find Microsoft Word or Microsoft 365 in your app list, you can use the\nuninstall troubleshooter\nfrom the official Microsoft website to safely remove Office 365 from your computer.\nReinstalling Word\nAs with the removal process, there are multiple methods for downloading Microsoft Word. If you have the Microsoft 365 suite linked to your device, you can individually re-download Word and other Office apps from the Microsoft Store.\nHowever, if you have to uninstall the full Microsoft 365 bundle, you can re-download all the apps at once by visiting the\napps page\non the Microsoft website. Click \"Install Apps\" at the top-right of the page, then select \"Microsoft 365 Apps\" from the drop-down menu.\nYou'll be taken to another page with a pop-up menu. Select the language and version of Microsoft 365 you want to download, then click \"Install.\" This will download an executable file labeled \"OfficeSetup.exe.\" Run the executable, and follow the included instructions to finish reinstalling Word.\nWith this fresh install, any issues caused by installation problems or corrupted data should be resolved, including the text glitch.\nWord's text glitches usually don't require any of the drastic methods I described here.

The apps don’t allow you to edit saved files. I created a file and saved it. Then when I went to open it, the file wouldn’t open or it opened I couldn’t edit it our copy it. This is since the last update and IOS to 26. And there is NO phone number to call to get this resolved.\nMeanwhile on my iMac M4 is see these files and can edit them there. Microsoft needs to fix this. This is just ridiculous.

It now opens the files but when you want to edit them, it still freezes up. I place the cursor at the end of a sentence and then backspace, and it wont delete any of the letters. But the cursor still blinks as if it were ready for typing and or editing. And when I go back to the files the icons of the files usually blink that says that the file has been uploaded back to One Drive. Then when I try to open the file, it opens but I cannot do anything with it.\n1 vote\nReport a concern\nDennis Goldensohn\n•\n20\nReputation points\n2025-10-20T20:31:56.35+00:00\nUntil this is resolved I will be creating Word Docs on my iMac and then send them via email attachment to myself. Then I will save them on my iPad where I have 512 GIGS of space. I also have alll of my One Drive documents saved on two external drives on my iMac.

I turned doff my iPad and then booted it up. I opened Word, and it seemed to be working, but when I opened a document and just placed the cursor at the end of a paragraph, I hit the space bar and it worked erratically. It looks like there is a linkage-con edition to the app and the cloud. I then closed Word and opened it agin, and it opened one the docs but I couldn’t edit anything. The cursor stayed where it was and the space bar had no affect on the document. There is in my opinion a synchronizing issue here. What is going on with your experiences. And yes, I loaded the update for Word, Excel, and PPT.\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nDennis Goldensohn\n•\n20\nReputation points\n2025-10-22T15:46:27.9233333+00:00\nI just got off the phone with Microsoft on the issues we are experiencing with Office. One Drive and Office 365. They stated that they are aware of the issues being a global node and they are working on it. In my discussions with the representative, I stated that there seems to be a synchronization issue where the apps do not sync with One Drive and when trying to edit it doesn’t allow you to. The representative stated that could be one o the issues that all end users are experiencing. So, it is not an individual user issue, it is an issue for those who are using Office on either an iPad or iPhone using IOS 26. I feel much better that it is not an issue with an individual user. So, we will see how long it takes for them to correct these issues. When the issues are corrected, we should see an update to Word, Excel, and PPT. Hope this answers some of your concerns!\n2 votes\nReport a concern\nSandy Weinberg\n•\n80\nReputation points\n2025-10-22T15:49:35.0133333+00:00\nThanks for sharing Dennis. 🙏\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nDennis Goldensohn\n•\n20\nReputation points\n2025-10-22T15:57:25.83+00:00\nI needed to get to the source to find out if it was an individual issue or a global issue.

I can only guess it’s because of the iOS 26 update, or just another bug that they haven’t fixed. The Word app has been having tons of issues since March and this is just the latest. They’ve been really slow to fix all the other problems and this will probably be the same, unfortunately.\n3 comments\nShow comments for this answer\nReport a concern\nSandy Weinberg\n•\n80\nReputation points\n2025-10-17T19:54:26.76+00:00\nThanks for confirming that Hannah.\n0 votes\nReport a concern\npenny newcombe\n•\n0\nReputation points\n2025-10-19T08:31:43.11+00:00\nSame! This is all on my IpadPro and I’m getting incredible frustrated. I can’t make edits, and sometimes can’t even see the file or move the mouse, or copy the text to paste it elsewhere. It’s seriously making tasks impossible and I have a lot of work to do. I have stuff I urgently need to do today ready for Monday. I’ve deleted the app and reinstalled, I’ve reset my IPad, I’ve downloaded all updates. But I cannot use it at all. What are we meant to do? I’ve paid a small fortune for my word subscription over the many years I’ve used it. I don’t know where to turn for help.

Sorry to hear you're experiencing issues editing your Word documents on your iPhone and iPad. I understand how frustrating this can be, especially when you rely on these tools across multiple devices for work or personal tasks.\nPlease make sure your Microsoft Word and other Office apps are updated via the App Store. Also, check that your iOS is running on a stable release version. If you're currently using iOS 26 Beta, consider downgrading to iOS 18.5 for better compatibility.\nNext, open the Word app on your iPhone or iPad, tap your profile icon, go to Account, then Manage Subscriptions. Confirm that your Microsoft 365 subscription is active and properly linked to your account.\nHope this helps.\nKind regards,\nJohn Oli\n7 comments\nShow comments for this answer\nReport a concern\nSandy Weinberg\n•\n80\nReputation points\n2025-10-17T19:56:12.5566667+00:00\nThanks John, No beta versions here.

I then closed the file(s) and then opened them and I can still edit them. I then went to One Drive and opened the same files and at the bottom you can click on Word and the file will open in it and I was able to edit the file and save it. I hope this corrects the issues that we were having. let me know ow if it worked for you.

Once a space is made I can space as much as I want.\nHere's the kickers: It is only with Any physical keyboards and only on the microsoft word App. The onscreen keyboard does not have this issue.\nI have tried many many things:\n-I bought a new keyboard -I reset Word settings -I uninstalled and reinstalled the app -I reset tablet keyboard settings. -I even reset my whole tablet to factory reset.\nNothing worked. Stupid me thinks its a keyboard shortcut I may have fat fingered, but it doesnt matter how many keyboards I switch out.

The more users who report an issue, the higher it gets on their priority list. Here’s how you can do it from another Office app (like Excel or PowerPoint):\nOpen the app and tap on your profile picture/initials.\nSelect\n\"Help & Feedback\".\nLook for an option like\n\"Tell Us What Can Be Better\"\nor\n\"Send Feedback\"\nand briefly describe the freezing/crashing issue with the Word app.\nPlease note that as a support moderator, I am unable to submit this report on your behalf. Microsoft's feedback system requires that reports come directly from the user's account to gather necessary diagnostic information. I hope you understand, as your report is vital for getting this resolved.\nIn the meantime, to help you continue your work, here is a temporary solution you can use with Word for the web: Access the full functionality of Word by logging into\nOffice 365\nthrough the Safari browser on your iPad. This is the most reliable workaround.\nNote: We appreciate your understanding regarding the scope of support available through this forum. As moderators, our role is to provide general guidance and assist with common troubleshooting steps. While we do not have access to internal systems or administrative tools required to resolve account-specific or backend-related issues, we’ll continue doing our best to support you within the scope of our responsibilities.\nThank you for your patience and understanding. Should you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out at any time.\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n2 comments\nShow comments for this answer\nReport a concern\nIan-Ng\n•\n8,975\nReputation points\n•\nMicrosoft External Staff\n•\nModerator\n2025-10-20T20:49:57.89+00:00\nHi\n@Ariane Haas\n,\nHope everything is going well on your end. I’m following up on the support thread we’ve been working on. Could you confirm if you’ve had a chance to submit feedback to our team? Your input is valuable and helps us improve and resolve the issue effectively.\nIf you have any additional questions or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out.\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nLaura Grundy\n•\n0\nReputation points\n2025-10-22T16:00:10.72+00:00\nHi\nI’m having the same issue since recent update.

Without logging in, the user can edit the Word file on their tablet.\nA couple more opening/closing after that, the Word App closes itself on startup.\nThe only resolution then is to delete the Data (not cache) of the app and start fresh. With that, starting the whole process anew.\nUp until now, we have been using the Word App without sign-in and were able to edit the documents fine without issue. But now this situation…\nI couldn’t find many applicable articles online.\nIs this a new behavior of the Word App?\nIs a Login now really mandatory in Order to edit Word files on Android? Or is there some kind of solution or workaround?\nHas anyone else experienced something like this?\nWe have many hundred tablets, so “just logging in with a MS Account” is not an option.\nA lot if not all tablets seem to have this issue.\nWe’ve been using Android 12 and 13 for our Tablets.\nOn those we use the Android Microsoft Word App Version 16.0.15427.20090\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nRegards\n1 Spice up\nsomedude2\n(somedude2)\nOctober 21, 2024,  7:52pm\n2\nWell, that version is 2 years old. Maybe try the july 4 2023 version? that is the latest on that api level…(28)  16.0.16501.20160\nIt could well have nothing to do with word, but be some update in the login/security API…\nWell, this is the weirdest MS licence I have seen yet:\nTo create or edit documents, sign in with a free Microsoft account on devices with a screen size smaller than 10.1 inches.\nUnlock the full Microsoft experience with a qualifying Microsoft 365 subscription for your phone, tablet, PC, and Mac…\nLOL!   Anyone got a 10.099 inch tablet?\nBut, this is really a subscription license through the store, so maybe it expired…\n“This app is provided by either Microsoft or a third-party app publisher…”\n2 Spice ups\nAlexZhang\n(AlexZhang)\nOctober 22, 2024,  7:52am\n3\nIt sounds like you are experiencing a frustrating issue with the Microsoft Word app on your tablet. Here are some steps and considerations that may help you resolve the issue.\nTroubleshooting Steps:\nUpdate the app: Make sure you have the latest version of the Microsoft Word app installed. Check the Google Play Store for updates and install any available updates.\nClear cache and data: While you mentioned that clearing your data may temporarily solve the problem, try clearing your cache periodically to see if it provides a more permanent solution.\nReinstall the App: Uninstall the Microsoft Word app and reinstall it from the Google Play store. This can sometimes resolve persistent issues.\nCheck permissions: Make sure the app has the necessary permissions.\nNotes:\nUser account requirements: Microsoft now seems to be enforcing stricter login rules. While you may have been able to use the app without signing in before, recent updates may now require a Microsoft account to continue using it.\nMicrosoft 365 Subscription: Certain features and functionality, especially after multiple uses, may require a Microsoft 365 subscription. This may be why you are prompted to sign in.\nBulk account management: If you need to sign in, consider creating a few shared Microsoft accounts to use across multiple tablets in your organization. tools such as Microsoft Intune can help manage multiple devices and user accounts more efficiently.\nIf none of the above solutions work, it’s best to contact Microsoft Support (\nhttps://support.microsoft.com\n) for more targeted help.\nvragor\n(Vragor)\nOctober 22, 2024,  8:09am\n4\nHello\n@somedude2\nThanks for reply.\nYeah, the licensing on this seems weird to me to.\nOn this Article, they mention the 10.1 inches as well. Though the wording is not exactly the same as yours.\nBut, we are using Tablets that are 8 inches. So at least that shouldn’t be an issue.\nAs far as I can tell, one doesn’t or usually shouldn’t need to log in with an MS account to view, create, edit and save word files on Android. At least not a couple of months ago.\nHave you found or know of anything that changed that recently?\nAs for the Word App Version, I did try a newer version at the start of my troubleshooting, but from the start this Version of word wants one to log in with an account to do anything. No more “sign in later” option.\nI tried again now with the Version arm64-v8a “Microsoft Word: Edit Documents 16.0.18025.20072 (2004235238)” from APKCombo and got the same behavior.\nSee image (german, with translation)\nimage\n660×1054 67.6 KB\nAnd then I also tried with the Version 16.0.16501.20160-2003501345 (com.microsoft.office.word_16.0.16501.20160-2003501345_minAPI28(armeabi-v7a)(640dpi)) from APK Mirror.\nThis one also had the same behavior as the 16.0.15427.20090\nHere some more screenshots for reference\nOn the old Version of Word 16.0.15427.20090 when launching the app for the first time, this is the first screen\nOn the old Version of Word 16.0.15427.20090, after opening a couple different word files on the device directly, this is the first warning. This one can be closed with the back button.\nTablet-Word-App-Problem-First-Login-Warning\n501×801 62.9 KB\nThese are just the first-time-app-opening popups that ask about privacy and sending data\nTablet-Word-App-Problem-Privacy-Data-Send\n1134×478 202 KB\nthe wording here changed to “This sign-in can only be skipped one more time”\nThis is after the last warning. Now the document cannot be edited.\nvragor\n(Vragor)\nOctober 22, 2024,  8:13am\n5\nThank you\n@AlexZhang\nfor your reply.\nI also checked with Copilot and chatGPT.\n1 Spice up\nvragor\n(Vragor)\nOctober 25, 2024,  6:41am\n6\nBumping this, still hoping to get a solution.\nThough it might seem, I will have to replace MS Word/Excel App with a different App.\nOr use the Azure Sync and make all the employees login. And maybe buy licenses…\nvragor\n(Vragor)\nOctober 28, 2024,  9:05am\n7\nMade the Switch to the\nMicrosoft 365 (Office) App\nSo far it seems to work with this app.\nNot requiring an Account and not crashing while being able to open Word and Excel files.\nSeems the standalone Versions of the Apps have different triggers and conditions for licensing than the MS 365 Office app.\nSo, for now - I’ll use the MS 365 App.\nRelated topics\nTopic\nReplies\nViews\nActivity\nMS Word (Android) crashes almost immediately upon starting\nMobile

Start Word application in Safe Mode\nSafe Mode can be a great way to get rid of situations like this. By using the Safe Mode for Microsoft Word, you will be able to troubleshoot such issues. This helps in disabling all third-party services as well as applications. When the other stuff is disabled, you can simply launch Word in Safe Mode to take a proper check on it if it works or not. Here are the needed steps to be followed when Word does not respond.\nStep 1:\nPress the Start key on your keyboard and look for Microsoft Word. Alternatively, you can press the \"Windows + S\" key combination and type in \"Microsoft Word\" to point the program.\nStep 2:\nAfter this, simply press the \"Ctrl\" key and hit on the Office Word program simultaneously. The Word will now be open in the Safe Mode.\nStep 3:\nYou can now check if the Microsoft Word is properly responding or not.

Save the Word Document to another Location\nApart from the MS Word application, there could be a problem with Mac storage. as well.

In this way, you can check if there is a problem with the MS Word application itself or your Mac system. Here's how you can boot your Mac in safe mode and fix\nMicrosoft Word crashing on Mac\n.\nSimply turn on your Mac by pressing the power button. If you are already using it, then restart it instead.\nAs soon as you would hear the startup chime (or see Apple's logo), press the Shift key on the keyword.\nKeep pressing it for the new few seconds as Mac would be restarted in the safe mode.\nYou can see \"Safe Mode\" written at the top right corner of the screen now. Just log in to any account and try accessing the MS Word application on it.\n8.

Blank, new, template, - it opens it, and the whole program closes.  I have searched, read, and tried things for hours now and I'm out of options that I can find or know of.   It did work for about two weeks and then it stopped.  No programs were added, changed etc.  Any suggestions or links to documents are appreciated.\nI have already done the following and nothing has worked or fixed the issue:\nChecked for updates - zero needed.  Fresh install on 12/22/21\nRe-named templates & created new ones.\nTurned off any add-ins (I didn't have any and only the MS ones were there)\nRan the office repair tool.\nRan the MS online download repair tool.\nAnti virus turned off\nFirewall turned off\nUninstalled office and reinstalled it - 5 times.\nThe computer I am using is an older system but an i7 with 64gb of ram and over 400gb free on the disk and 800gb on a second drive free.  I have formatted the drives and did a clean install of windows and updated all drivers on 12/22/21.   This is about as clean of a system as can be.  I'm at a lost what to try next.  Excel works fine which completely baffles me.\n***Solution***\nAfter a few weeks of trying things, I contacted MS support.\nThey manually removed all of office from files to folders to every registry entry - and reinstalled it. What the support person did, was far deeper than I have ever seen done and I actually worked as a first level support tech (many) years ago. Evidently even the normal uninstall and reinstall didn't remove enough to catch it nor did any of the basic registry edits.\nEvidently a .dll file was missing.\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Word | For business | Windows\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Word | For business | Windows\nA family of Microsoft word processing software products for creating web, email, and print documents.\nSign in to follow\nLocked Question.\nThis question was migrated from the Microsoft Support Community.

Does the problem still occur if you start Word in Safe Mode by holding down the CTRL key while starting it until asked to confirm that you want to start it in that mode?\nIf not, see the section dealing with Add-Ins in the KnowledgeBase article \"How to troubleshoot problems that occur when you start or use Word\" at:\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/921541\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2022-01-22T07:46:27+00:00\nThank you for the link! - I'll have to comb through it tomorrow and try some of the things.\nOpening Word in Safe Mode does work - I forgot to mention that.  I have not been able to find a list of what safe mode all turns off or bypasses so I can troubleshoot.   If anyone has a link to a comprehensive list, that would be wonderful.\nI am confused by all the 1000's articles about \"Add-Ins\" as I have just the couple default ones.  It seems like it's the imaginary blue herring that everyone is supposed to say but actually does nothing.  I'm sure there are situations where some have many, but this is a stand-alone home machine and has just the basics.  That said, I have turned them off, and it still crashes.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nDoug Robbins - MVP - Office Apps and Services\n•\n322.5K\nReputation points\n•\nMVP\n•\nVolunteer Moderator\n2022-01-22T10:20:29+00:00\nWhen you start Word in Safe Mode, if there are any Add-ins stored in the Word\\STARTUP folder, they will not be loaded\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2022-01-24T02:24:21+00:00\nHi JB Phoenix：\nI read your previous reply carefully.\nIt seems that Word works fine in safe mode. Safe Mode can check for add-ons or extensions that may cause startup problems. In that case, Please try disabling the app's add-ons and check the results. Click on File tab -> Options -> Click on Add-ons -> Clear all options.\nIf the problem persists, you can try\nperforming a clean boot in Windows\ndetermine whether a background program is interfering with your Office application.\nAt the same time, could you provide us with a screenshot of the version information?\nThank you for all your efforts so far and we are very sorry for the inconvenience caused to you.\nHope this will help you.\nTin\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2022-01-22T15:32:40+00:00\nHere is what my Add-On's looks like in safe mode.  There is basically nothing.\nIn \"Normal\" mode.\nAs you can see, there is nothing.

For instance, a student working on a thesis document has to deal with various images, charts, and multiple other elements. Thus, they may have to face the freezing issue because the software struggles to process heavy files on systems with limited RAM or outdated versions.\nSuch interruptions can lead to loss of unsaved work and frustrations for the user. Therefore, repairing this issue improves Word’s functionality, allowing users to continue working on their documents without further crashes or interruptions. The purpose of this article is to provide practical solutions for users facing\nMicrosoft Word keeps freezing\nissues.\nIn this article\nPart 1.

Repair Word File to Avoid Microsoft Word Crash\nKey Features\nGuide to Use Repairit for Repairing Corrupted/Damaged Word Documents\nPart 1. Why Does Your Word Keep Freezing and Crashing?\nLet us begin this discussion by looking into the top reasons why your\nWord crashes. This section will help you figure out the root cause of the issue and will help you resolve it.\nLarge Document Sizes:\nMS Word struggles with huge files containing images, tables, and other elements with different formatting styles. This can overload the program and the file itself, which causes it to freeze or crash while you are working.\nOutdated Software:\nRunning an older version of Word might make it incompatible with your operating system. Regular updates ensure the software runs smoothly and include bug fixes.\nCorrupted Files or Templates:\nDamaged documents can disrupt the software’s normal behavior, affecting the workflow in a negative way. Using a proper method through a third-party tool, such as repairing them or simply replacing them, can be a quick fix to this.\nLack of System Resources:\nWord requires adequate RAM and CPU power to operate efficiently. If your computer is low on resources, it may cause Word to crash or freeze.\nPoor Add-ins:\nImplementing third-party add-ins that are poorly optimized may interfere with Word’s functionality. As you disable the unnecessary add-ins, you can resolve the conflict manually.\nPart 2. Some Simplistic Solutions to Microsoft Word Keeps Freezing and Crashing\nWhen your Microsoft Word keeps freezing, it is due to different reasons that we already discussed. Considering these reasons, we can look for effective and simple solutions to resolve this issue with comprehensive steps.\n1. Consider Repairing the Word File Directly\nSometimes, the Microsoft Word crash is not triggered by the software, but it is due to corrupted files that you’re trying to open. These corrupted or damaged files can lead to this issue and make your Word freeze or crash unexpectedly.\nTherefore, addressing the document will ensure that you can open the file easily and maintain its content. So, let’s look at the instructions on how to repair the file directly:\nStep 1.\nOpen the MS Word on your device, head to the\n“Open”\ntab, and click the\n“Browse”\noption to locate and open your corrupted file.\nStep 2.\nOn a new dialog box, select any Word file that experiences freezing, press the down arrow in front of\n“Open,”\nand choose the\n“Open and Repair”\nchoice in the drop-down menu. The file will open directly on the software after it’s been repaired.\n2. Restart Word or PC\nRestarting Word can remove any minor software glitches or conflict issues it might be facing that are causing the crash. The process will also clear out the system’s cache and remove any improperly utilized resources.\nThis way, you’ll have a clean Word to work with, with no sudden freeze time, crashes, and more. The following are the quick and simple steps you can follow to restart Word on your PC:\nStep 1.\nOpen the\n“Task Manager”\nwindow by tapping the relevant icon on the taskbar. From the\n“Processes”\ntab, right-click the\n“Microsoft Word”\noption and hit the\n“End Task”\noption. Now, simply relaunch this document processing tool to see if the issue is fixed.\nStep 2.\nTo restart the PC, navigate to the bottom left corner and press the\n“Windows”\nicon to access a menu. After that, in the\n“Power”\noptions, click the\n“Restart”\noption to initiate the PC restart process.\n3. Run Microsoft Word in Safe Mode\nUsers can easily diagnose and troubleshoot problems in Word by opening it in a minimal state, a safe mode. This mode disables the customizations, extensions, and add-ins of the software that might cause the “\nMS Word keeps crashing\n” problem.\nMoreover, if the problem resolves itself, the real problem lies in the disabled options. Follow the given steps to learn how to open Word in safe mode:\nStep 1.\nPress the\n“Win + R”\nkeys from the keyboard and write\n“winword/safe”\nin the “Open” section. Once that’s written down, click the\n“OK”\nbutton to open Word in safe mode.\nStep 2.\nUpon doing so, press the\n“File”\ntab at the top right corner and choose to\n“Open”\nany file to see if the Word freezing issue still persists.\nTry it Free\nFor Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10/11\nTry it Free\nFor macOS 10.12 or later\n4. Disable Add-ins from Word Settings\nAlthough add-ins enhance Word’s functionality, they might introduce issues, like the “Microsoft Word keeps crashing.” That is why you need to eliminate the potential compatibility issues with these third-party add-ins.\nBesides, when you find out the real causes of the problem, it is easy to figure out whether to remove the add-ins or replace them. Users can access them by following these comprehensive steps:\nStep 1.\nStart by heading to the MS Word software and accessing the\n“Options”\ndialog box through the\n“More”\nmenu.\nStep 2.\nMoving forward, click the “Add-ins” tab in the\n“Word Options”\ndialog box and go to the\n“Manage”\nsection. From here, select\n“COM Add-ins”\nfrom the bottom-up menu and hit the\n“Go…”\nbutton to proceed.\nStep 3.\nWhen the COM Add-ins window appears, uncheck every option under the\n“Add-ins Available”\nsection. Once that’s done, hit the\n“OK”\nbutton to disable every add-in in Word.\n5. Repair Microsoft Office\nSometimes, unexpected issues arise with Word, especially after events like a sudden shutdown or an incomplete update. These causes can lead to the “Word keeps freezing” issue, making it frustrating to deal with in a workload crisis.\nHowever, you can easily repair MS Word and restore it to its original state without ruining anything. We have provided you with the following steps on how to repair the Office:\nStep 1.\nSearch for\n“Control Panel”\nin the Windows\n“Search Bar”\nand click the\n“Programs and Features”\noption when it opens.\nStep 2.\nOnce the next screen appears, hit the\n“Microsoft Office”\nand press the\n“Change”\noption from the above toolbar.\nStep 3.\nSubsequently, a new menu will appear, letting you choose your desired repair mode and click the\n“Repair”\nbutton to proceed.\n6. Uninstall and Reinstall Microsoft Office\nIf repairing Office is unsuccessful, you can opt to uninstall and reinstall MS Office to return it to its original state. This way, all traces of corrupt files, entries, and configuration settings will be flushed away, resulting in frozen crashing or malfunctioning of Word.

It's been working fine for 147 pages. One list ends on page 147 and come page 148 for a new list, it suddenly stops me from restarting the list from 1 for no apparent reason.\nNo matter what I do, it doesn't change back to 1. It either continues from where the last list left off, or it removes all numbers after 1 from every list previously. Manually setting the start point to 1 does nothing. I cannot create a new multi-level list or apply any existing default ones. Word behaves like I didn't do anything when I try.\nI've tried using no break, page break, section break, etc between 147 and 148 with no joy. Nothing has changed whatsoever between pages 147 and 148. I've reverted back to an earlier save and again at exactly the same point, it suddenly stops me from restarting a list.\nAs far as I can remember, lists in word have always been a PITA. The only \"advice\" I can find from Microsoft is to \"start again in a new document\".  Absolute joke. Has anyone got a workaround for this?\nMy Computer\nYou need to have JavaScript enabled so that you can use this ...\nMy Computer\nComputer Type:\nPC/Desktop\nOS:\nWindows 10 Home\nCPU:\nAMD Ryzen 5 3600\nMemory:\n16GB\nGraphics Card:\nAMD Radeon 5700XT\nBrowser:\nChrome\nAntivirus:\nWindows Defender\nQuote\nCarmano\nPosts :\n76\nWindows 10 Home\nNew\n06 Oct 2023\n#2\nI try to avoid using autonumbering in Word because, as you found, it just breaks down.\nI use a small number of paragraph styles for numbered lists.

Every bit of formatting in my docs are controlled via Styles, it just makes my work easier.\nIt just seems that after a certain file size/page count/list count, Word has some bugs where things just stop working. Once it happens, that file will break at the same point every time. Doesn't matter what you do or what comes after. Delete some of the pages before the issue, and you can write some more until the page count/file size gets back to where it was before.\nJust seems like there is a memory limitation and MS have never bothered to fix it as numbered lists have always been problematic since MS Word 2003. It's like MS don't actually use their own software packages with the amount of basic longstanding bugs that have never been addressed.\nI ended up splitting the document into two and then merging the two resulting PDF's together.

It's a prime example of MS not using their own products in my opinion. Not only is it somewhat clunky, it's a ticking timebomb waiting to irrevocably destroy all your work, usually sometime during the last hour of work.\nDespite being a fairly common and serious bug, it's not changed since 2003 (and most likely earlier). All MS have done with Office since the 2000's is just copy Apple in GUI (I still hate the Ribbon GUI.

A complete (online) repair should do the trick; if it doesn't, you probably have to remove all remnants of Office using the Uninstall support tool (see Option 2 in the article at\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8\n) and start fresh with a reinstallation.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a

If a reboot doesn't solve the problem, disabling add-ins and repairing the program are the best courses of action.\nStart Word in Safe Mode\n. Loading the application without templates and add-ins allows you to see if the program works as it should or if it is corrupted.\nDisable add-ins. If \"Word not responding\" is not an error in\nSafe Mode\n, an incompatible add-in is a likely culprit.\nSelect\nFile\n>\nOptions\n>\nAdd-ins\n.\nChoose\nGo\nat the bottom of the window to open the\nCOM Add-ins\ndialog box.\nClear the check boxes next to each add-in to disable all add-ins.\nSelect\nOK\nto apply the changes and close the dialog box.\nIf the \"Word not responding\" error message no longer appears, enable each add-in one at a time, and restart Word after each one to determine which one caused the problem.\nRepair the document\n.

I click repair, but the next time I try to open word, the same thing happens.  I NEED the program to work properly every time.

You need to do a normal. Repair.  See:\nRepair an Office application - Microsoft Support\nAlso, you can use Control Panel>Programs and Features (small icons). Right click on your Office>Change>Quick repair or Online repair which includes reinstallation of Office.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2023-10-31T08:20:59+00:00\nI see all of the other similar questions about this problem. Is Microsoft going to do anything about this ?\nI doubt it, as it as been like this for as long as I can remember.  It is not possible to judge the extent because once a user finds out what to do they do not need to post on this forum.  It is only users new to the problem that post on here.  That is why I highlight that it is a bug.  I am fed up having to do this!\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2023-10-30T15:03:21+00:00\nIt is a bug.

I'm Gunasekar and I'd be happy to help you with your question.\nI understand that you are experiencing issues with Microsoft Word which stops working intermittently and throws the error. You could try the following suggestions below one by one and check the outcome.\nOpen Word in Safe mode.\nWhen you run Word in safe mode, it bypasses functionality and settings such as alternative startup location, changed toolbars, startup folders used by Word, Word add-ins, and most COM add-ins. While add-ins can enhance your experience, they can occasionally interfere, or conflict with Word.\nTo open Word in safe mode, Click Windows Key + R altogether, \nType winword /safe \nClick enter.\nInstall the latest updates.\nYou might need to set Windows Update to automatically download and install recommended updates.\nOpen Microsoft Word > Select File > Accounts > Update Options > Click Update Now.\nIf that didn't work, as 'RonBarker' suggested,\nRepair Office applications.\nA. Click Start and select Settings.\nB. Click Apps and Features.\nC. Find Microsoft Office 365 in the lists, and click three dots next to it.\nD. select Modify.\nE. Perform an Online repair.\nWhen it is done, Restart your PC.\nI hope this information helps.

They are sent through email and then I download them. Have never had a problem with \"not responding\" before. I tried using the online 365 rather than the copy on my PC. Did not work. Tried downloading Office again to my computer directly from the online account. Tried restarting my computer. Have run a virus scan, showing no problems. What else can I do?\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Word | For home | Windows\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Word | For home | Windows\nA family of Microsoft word processing software products for creating web, email, and print documents.\nSign in to follow\nLocked Question.\nThis question was migrated from the Microsoft Support Community.

I don't work for Microsoft and do not have access to any of your data on their system.\nIf you're experiencing issues with Microsoft Word freezing or becoming unresponsive when making comments or corrections to documents, here are a few additional steps you can try to resolve the problem:-\nDisable add-ins: Add-ins in Microsoft Word can sometimes conflict with the software, causing freezing or slowdowns. Try disabling any add-ins that you may have installed and see if the issue persists. You can do this by going to the \"File\" menu, selecting \"Options,\" and then navigating to the \"Add-ins\" section. From there, you can manage and disable any add-ins.\nRepair Office installation: Run the repair option for Microsoft Office to fix any potential issues with the installation. You can access the repair option by going to the Control Panel (Windows) or System Preferences (Mac), selecting \"Programs\" or \"Applications,\" finding Microsoft Office in the list of installed programs, and choosing the repair option.\nUse Safe Mode: Launching Microsoft Word in Safe Mode can help troubleshoot if the issue is related to a conflict with another program or add-in. To start Word in Safe Mode, hold down the Ctrl key while launching Word. If Word functions normally in Safe Mode, it indicates that an add-in or customization may be causing the freezing issue.\nI hope this information helps. If you have any questions, please let me know and I'll be glad to assist you further or If you find it helpful, you can mark this comment as the answer.\nKind regards\nTim\n0 comments\nNo comments\nAnonymous\n2023-06-16T18:13:22+00:00\nI have no Add-Ins other than a couple COM add-ins that have been there since I got the computer.\nI ran Repair on Word.\nI ran in Safe Mode and it still isn't working properly.\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions please?\nWord works perfectly fine when I am editing a file produced by AI and not making any comments or highlights.\nThe ones that aren't working is when I have a student who sends me a transcript via email and I am attempting to grade it by highlighting the errors and giving feedback as comments. I have been doing this same action for months without any problems and have not changed or added any add-ins.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nAnonymous\n2023-06-18T16:52:02+00:00\nActually, the first time I ran the Repair, I just did it on Word. I went back in and ran a repair on the Office 365 and it worked to correct my issue. It seems to be working now. Usually when I open those student files, I get a band at the top that I have to click Allow Editing before every job. I would assume that accomplishes the same thing as Unblock. I did try Unblock on one and that banner went away. That was after I had run a second Repair on the whole Office app.\nHopefully, I am good for now. Thanks for the help from both of you.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nStefan Blom\n•\n332.7K\nReputation points\n•\nMVP\n•\nVolunteer Moderator\n2023-06-16T19:38:17+00:00\nAfter you have downloaded a student document, right-click its icon in File Explorer and click Properties. In the Properties window, click Unblock and then click Apply.

It is the only product I am having issues with.  I have tried opening Word on its own and I've tried opening a Word document.  Both begin to open and then once the loading circle finishes its cycle, the app and the document close.  The next time I try to open, it asks if I want to open in Safe Mode.  It opens without issue in Safe Mode.  There is not an error message or code.\nHere's what I've tried:\nI have tried to repair.\nI've done the online repair.\nI've uninstalled completely and reinstalled along with restarting the computer.\nI have turned off ALL add-ins and I've actually uninstalled the one that I thought was causing the issue (and restarted the computer).\nWhen I open with winword /a, it opens without issue which leads me to believe that there may be some issue with a template or with my Normal template.\nIf there is an issue with a template, I have been unable to locate an answer to how to fix that issue on the Microsoft Forums.\nThank you for your assistance.\nAimee\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Word | For home | Windows\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Word | For home | Windows\nA family of Microsoft word processing software products for creating web, email, and print documents.\nSign in to follow\nLocked Question.\nThis question was migrated from the Microsoft Support Community.

Let’s troubleshoot this step by step:\nSince Word opens without issues in Safe Mode, it’s likely that an add-in or template is causing the problem. Let’s proceed with further troubleshooting.\nTemplates and Add-Ins:\nTemplates: Word uses templates to create new documents. If there’s an issue with your Normal template, it can cause problems. Try the following:\nClose Word.\nPress Windows + R, type %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Templates, and press Enter.\nRename the Normal.dotm file to something else (e.g., Normal_old.dotm).\nRestart Word and check if it opens normally.\nAdd-Ins: Add-ins can sometimes conflict with Word. Disable them and see if the issue persists:\nGo to File > Options > Add-Ins.\nUnder Manage, select COM Add-ins and click Go.\nUncheck all add-ins and click OK.\nRestart Word and check if it opens correctly.\nRegistry Cleanup:\nSometimes, remnants of old installations or settings in the Windows registry can cause issues. Use the following steps carefully:\nPress Windows + R, type regedit, and press Enter.\nNavigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Word.\nDelete the Data key (backup the registry before making changes).\nRestart Word and check if it opens normally.\nRepair Office Installation:\nYou’ve already tried repairing, but let’s do it again:\nGo to Control Panel > Programs and Features.\nFind Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications.\nClick on it and choose Change.\nSelect Online Repair and follow the prompts.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concern.\nBest regards, \nEngineTyme.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\n1 additional answer\nSort by:\nMost helpful\nMost helpful\nNewest\nOldest\nAnonymous\n2024-03-19T12:01:30+00:00\nThank you so much!

It’s happened to me more times than I’d like to admit—and I know I’m not alone. As someone who relies on Word daily, those crashes can be incredibly frustrating. They waste my time, break my focus, and sometimes even cost me unsaved work. Whether it’s a\ncorrupted file\n, outdated software, or a buggy add-in, I’ve seen how unpredictable Word can get. That’s why I put together this guide—to share the most common reasons behind Word crashes and exactly how I fixed them. I’ll also show you how to recover your lost documents if a crash already wiped out something important.\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nWhy Does Microsoft Word Keep Crashing on Windows?\nBefore you can fix the issue, it’s important to understand what’s causing it. When Microsoft Word crashes, it often shows an error message prompting you to close the program due to a malfunction. Several common factors could be behind this:\nOutdated Word versions\n: Running an old version of Word can lead to compatibility issues and file corruption. Updating to the latest version often resolves these problems.\nCorrupted Word documents\n: Trying to open a damaged file can crash the software. Similarly, corrupted cache files may also cause Word to freeze or shut down unexpectedly.\nFaulty add-ins\n: Some third-party add-ins can interfere with Word’s functionality. Disabling or removing them may stop the crashes.\nA quick fix worth trying first: restart your computer. Sometimes, system-level glitches can cause Word to crash, and a simple reboot might resolve the issue without further troubleshooting.\nFixing Microsoft Word Crash Issues – Three Effective Methods\nMethod 1. Disable Active Add-ins to Fix Word Crashes\nThird-party add-ins are a common cause of Microsoft Word crashing unexpectedly. Disabling them helps pinpoint if an add-in is the problem and often resolves the issue quickly. Here’s how you can do it:\nStep 1:\nOpen Microsoft Word (if possible) and click the File tab in the top-left corner.\nStep 2:\nSelect Options near the bottom of the left sidebar to open Word’s settings.\nStep 3:\nIn the Options window, click Add-ins from the left menu.\nStep 4:\nLook at the bottom of the window for the Manage dropdown. Make sure COM Add-ins is selected, then click Go.\nStep 5:\nIn the popup window, you’ll see a list of all installed add-ins. Uncheck all the boxes to disable them temporarily.\nStep 6:\nClick OK to save your changes, then close Word completely.\nStep 7:\nRestart Word and check if it still crashes.\nIf Word runs smoothly now, one of the add-ins was likely causing the issue. You can re-enable them one at a time to identify which one is problematic. Check out our guide on\nQuick Fixes for Microsoft Word Not Responding on Windows 11\nfor more solutions.\nMethod 2. Update Microsoft Office\nRunning an outdated version of Office can cause crashes due to bugs or compatibility issues. Updating Office often fixes these problems. Follow these steps to update manually:\nStep 1:\nOpen Microsoft Word or Excel. Click File > Account (or Office Account).\nStep 2:\nUnder Product Information on the right, click the Update Options button.\nStep 3:\nFrom the dropdown, select Update Now.\nStep 4:\nOffice will check for updates and install them automatically—this may take a few minutes.\nStep 5:\nOnce updates are installed, restart Word and see if it runs more smoothly.\n🔄 Don’t forget to update Windows as well. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update, then click Check for updates and install anything available. Microsoft Word crashing can sometimes be caused by outdated Windows components.\nMethod 3. Repair Microsoft Office to Fix Crashes\nRepairing Office can resolve issues causing Word to crash. There are two repair options: Quick Repair and Online Repair.\nStep 1:\nPress Win + R, type\ncontrol\n, and hit Enter to open Control Panel.\nStep 2:\nGo to Programs and Features, find Microsoft Office, right-click it, and select Change.\nStep 3:\nChoose Quick Repair first and click Repair. Wait for it to finish.\nStep 4:\nIf problems persist, repeat the steps but choose Online Repair to reinstall Office without affecting your files.\nTip:\nBefore running an Online Repair, it’s a good idea to back up your important documents. If you’re also experiencing unresponsiveness in Word, check out our guide on\nWhat to Do When Word is Not Responding: Simple Solutions 2025\nfor more helpful tips.\nFinal Option: Reinstall Microsoft Office\nIf you’ve tried all the previous fixes and Microsoft Word continues to crash, a full reinstall of the Office suite can often resolve stubborn issues that repair tools can’t fix. Here’s a step-by-step approach to reinstall Office safely:\nStep 1:\nOpen Settings on your Windows PC and navigate to Apps > Installed Apps (or Apps & Features).\nStep 2:\nScroll through the list to find Microsoft Office, click on it, and select Uninstall. Follow the on-screen prompts to remove the software completely.\nStep 3:\nOnce uninstalled, restart your computer to clear out any remaining files or settings.\nStep 4:\nReinstall Office by signing in to your Microsoft 365 account or using your product key. Follow the instructions to download and install the latest version.\nReinstalling ensures you start fresh with a clean Office installation, which can fix persistent crashes caused by corrupted files or settings. Just remember to back up any important files before uninstalling, although your documents themselves won’t be deleted during this process.\nRecovering Deleted or Lost Word Documents\nUnsaved documents might be lost when Word crashes often. Accidental deletion, formatting, partition loss, and hard drive damage can also delete Word files.\nWinfrGUI\ncan recover irreversibly deleted Word files.\nDownload WinfrGUI Free\nFollow these steps to recover your Word document:\nChoose Word file location: Select the disk or folder where you lost the Word document and click “Find Lost Data”.\nFind your Word document: The program will examine the disk for lost data. After scanning, choose “Documents” in the left sidebar, pick the Word file, then click “Preview.”\nRecovery of Deleted Word Documents: After previewing, choose the Word document and click “Recover.” It’s crucial to save the restored document somewhere. OneDrive or Dropbox are suggested cloud storage services for file saving.\nBy following these steps, you can effectively recover lost Word documents.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ1. Why does Microsoft Word keep crashing when I open a specific document?\nIf Word only crashes when opening one document, that file might be corrupted. Try opening it in Draft view or Safe Mode, or use the Open and Repair feature:\nOpen Word > File > Open > Browse to your file.\nClick the dropdown next to Open, then choose Open and Repair.\nQ2. How do I start Microsoft Word in Safe Mode?\nSafe Mode loads Word without any add-ins or custom settings, which can help troubleshoot crashes:\nPress Windows + R, type\nwinword /safe\n, then hit Enter.\nIf Word opens normally, an add-in or extension is likely causing the issue.\nQ3. Will repairing Microsoft Office delete my files?\nNo. Both Quick Repair and Online Repair do not delete your personal Word documents or settings. However, Online Repair reinstalls Office, so it’s smart to back up any templates or macros just in case.\nQ4. Can antivirus software make Word crash?\nYes, occasionally antivirus or security software can interfere with Microsoft Office programs. Try temporarily disabling your antivirus or adding Word to the exception list to see if that helps.\nQ5. What should I do if Word crashes after a recent Windows update?\nSometimes updates introduce compatibility issues. Try:\nRolling back the update via Settings > Windows Update > Update History > Uninstall updates.\nChecking for new Office updates, which may include fixes.\nRunning Word in compatibility mode: Right-click Word shortcut > Properties > Compatibility > Check Run this program in compatibility mode.\nSummary\nIf Microsoft Word crashed during your work, you’re not alone—but you’re definitely not helpless. With the tips above, you can troubleshoot the crashes, get Word running smoothly again, and recover any lost files. Whether it’s disabling add-ins, updating Office, or using a tool like WinfrGUI to bring back deleted documents, there’s always a way to bounce back.

As soon as I enabled it, everything started to work just fine.\nOnce again thank you guys for helping me. Without your support I would have taken ages to find out what was wrong. The IT department is not very familiar with MacOS, only Windows, so I don't believe they would have discovered that was an extension problem that fast.\nBest regards from Brazil.\nReply\nLink\nUser profile for user:\n      Ricardo_rqo\nRicardo_rqo\nAuthor\nUser level:\nLevel 1\n10 points\nMay 10, 2025 9:28 AM in response to Owl-53\nThanks for the advices, guys. I reinstalled office once again, this time directly from Microsoft (not from Apple Store). I opened a new document and MS Word worked just fine. Then tried to open the files I was having problems before the safe mode, and immediately crashed. So I started the Mac on safe mode, but the issued remained: as soon as I opened my work files, it crashes. So I thought that maybe the issue are something on the files (but what?) and considering what BDAqua suggested I opened the file in Pages (not Libre Office) and the file (the same that crashed word) worked just fine. With this in mind I tried to copy all content from that file in Pages and paste it in MS Word and\nthe problem didn't occur and I could edit it without any problems\n, only minor things regarding the image sizes from the original document and font sizes in some parts of the text. So, it is indeed something in the files from my work that are causing the crash. Do you guys have any idea of how can I address that? And thank you for the insights!\nReply\nLink\nUser profile for user:\n      BDAqua\nBDAqua\nUser level:\nLevel 10\n250,259 points\nMay 10, 2025 12:30 AM in response to Ricardo_rqo\nAs a test, see if the Free LibreOffice does the same thing.\nReply\nLink\nUser profile for user:\n      steve626\nsteve626\nUser level:\nLevel 6\n14,277 points\nMay 10, 2025 9:35 AM in response to Ricardo_rqo\nI am guessing that the problematic files got corrupted during the earlier turmoil.\nIf Pages can open them, Pages offers an option to EXPORT in Word format. That may work better than the copy/paste method you are using, assuming Word can now open the resaved file.\nReply\nLink\nUser profile for user:\n      Owl-53\nOwl-53\nUser level:\nLevel 10\n103,699 points\nMay 10, 2025 11:12 AM in response to Ricardo_rqo\nI am away from computer for awhile\nII would follow the advise o @ Allan Jones and contact your IT department\nReply\nLink\nUser profile for user:\n      Ricardo_rqo\nRicardo_rqo\nAuthor\nUser level:\nLevel 1\n10 points\nMay 12, 2025 7:21 AM in response to Allan Jones\nGood catch. Global Protect is indeed what we use as VPN provider to access our files from work. Thanks for your advice. I'll contact them and see what can be done about this pending authorization. With some luck that solves the issue. It's strange because until last week everything was working fine.

I hope one of them comes through.\nRunning sfc now just in case. Didn’t go too far down the Windows troubleshooting route since Explorer and other programs can create folders, but definitely worth looking into (I hope). It found and successfully repaired some corrupt files, but I can’t tell yet whether they were relevant.\nI also have a restore point from 6 March I can try reverting to and seeing if that makes a difference (will try that after hours).\nWill take a deeper look at the more involved fixes later too.\nClients require native Word files, otherwise I’d consider scaling back to Fleet System 2 from my C=64 days (it even had spell checking!).\nTrying to preserve customizations will be excruciating if only because they’re spread out so much. Templates, macros, ribbon changes, Outlook rules, styles, and a few other things have built-in export tools or easy folders to find. But the settings tweaks? Maybe screenshots? Same with add-ins maybe.\nKeybindings is going to be a huge mess. I have tons saved that I only know through muscle memory. Most are mapped to my mouse (a 100 or so button gaming mouse that makes a HUGE difference during the workday) so that might help.\nThe vexing thing is not knowing what to preserve before running the\nOffice uninstall\nroutine. Whatever is not saved is lost.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2024-02-28T06:11:47+00:00\nDear Aarya Gohil,\nGood day!!\nApologies for the inconvenience caused and please don’t worry, let’s work together on your concern and move towards a resolution path.\nI understand your concern and I would like to confirm whether you are having the Word app crash issue when saving the Word documents on the Mac or Windows.\nIf it’s Mac, please check whether the Word app is up to date: Open the Word app> Click on the Help in the Menu bar> Check for the updates.\nIf you are using the latest version of the Word app but still having the issue, then I would like to suggest you perform the below steps and check the outcome:\nQuit the Word app> Open the Finder> Click Command + Shift + G> Enter ~/Library/Containers> Scroll down to Microsoft Word folder> Move the Microsoft Word to the Desktop location> Restart your Mac> Open the Word app and check the outcome.\nIf the same problem happens, I would like to suggest you to launch your Mac in the Safe Mode and check whether the same issue happens:\nStart up your Mac in safe mode - Apple Support (IN)\nIf you are using the Windows OS instead of MacOS, I would like to suggest you check whether your Word app is up to date:\nOpen Word document> File> Account> Update Options> Update Now.\nIf the Word app is up to date, I would like to confirm whether the same problem happens when you launch your Word app in the Safe Mode:\nOpen Office apps in safe mode on a Windows PC - Microsoft Support\nIf still having the issue, I would like to suggest you perform Online Repair to the Office apps:\nRepair an Office application - Microsoft Support\nIf it doesn’t work, can you please share the following information which will help us to better understand and guide you further:\nDoes the problem happens on a specific document or all Word documents?\nAre you using Windows OS or Mac OS?\nScreenshot of the Word app Account page:\nWindows OS: Open the Word document> Click on the File> Account> Take a screenshot and share it with us.\nMac OS: Open the Word app> Click on the Word in the Menu bar> About Word.\nAppreciate your patience and understanding.

Now everything is in Office 365 and it seems like nothing works the way I want it to. For example, in the old version of Word when I was in a document I could see exactly what line I was on. Like line 4.3. If i had a heading that I wanted to repeat on multiple pages I could make sure the heading appeared at exactly Line 4.3 so that it would be uniform throughout the document. Now I am working on a similar Word document and I can no longer see where my position is on the page. It is not in the bottom status bar. I googled this and the standard response is \"just right click on the bottom status bar and you can fix this.\" Well that doesn't work...no amount of right clicking in the bottom status bar does anything for me.\nI am also working on another document and I want to change the header. No amount of clicking in the header or viewing \"header and footer\" is working. I can completely delete the header but I should be able to just edit it instead of deleting it.\nI am really spending hours googling and messing with these issues that I never had problems with in the past. Can i just buy the full regular version of Word?\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Subscription, account, billing | For home | Windows\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Subscription, account, billing | For home | Windows\nMicrosoft 365 features that help users manage their subscriptions, account settings, and billing information.\nSign in to follow\nLocked Question.\nThis question was migrated from the Microsoft Support Community.

account.\nHello,\nSelect a different account.\nYou have multiple accounts\nChoose the account you want to sign in with.\nSummary\nThis article describes how to troubleshoot problems that may occur when you start or use Microsoft Word. Use the following methods in the order in which they are presented. If you try one of these methods and it does not help, go to the next method.\nResolution\nVerify or install the latest updates\nYou might have to set Windows Update to automatically download and install recommended updates. Installing any important, recommended, and optional updates can frequently correct problems by replacing out-of-date files and fixing vulnerabilities. To install the latest Microsoft Office updates, see\nUpdate Office and your computer with Microsoft Update\n.\nFor list of the latest Office updates, see\nOffice Updates\n. If your issue is not resolved after you install the latest Windows and Office updates, go to method 2.\nIt's a good idea to make sure that your computer has the latest updates installed for Windows. Updates often fix software problems. Before you use any of the following methods, try first to install updates. After you install the updates, restart your computer, and then start Word.\nTroubleshoot problems that occur when you start Word\nIMPORTANT:\nFollow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it,\nback up the registry\nin case there are problems and you need to restore it later.\nMethod 1: Insert your document into another file\nThe final paragraph mark in a Word document contains information about the document. If the document is damaged, you may be able to retrieve the text of the document if you can omit this final paragraph mark.\nTo access a document but leave its final paragraph mark behind, follow these steps:\nClick\nFile > New > Blank Document.\nOn the\nInsert\ntab, click\nObject\n, and then click\nText from File\n.\nSelect the file that you want to open and insert, and then click\nInsert\n.\nMethod 2: Start Word by using the /a switch\nThe /\na\nswitch is a troubleshooting tool that is used to determine where a problem may exist in Word. The /\na\nswitch prevents add-ins and global templates from being loaded automatically. The /a switch also locks the settings files to prevent it from being read or modified. To start Word by using the /a switch, follow these steps:\nClick\nStart > Search\n, then type \"Run\" and press Enter.\nIn the Run popup window, type \"winword /a\", and press Enter.\nFor more information about the /\na\nswitch, see\nDescription of the \"/a\" startup switch in Word\n.\nIf the problem does not occur when you start Word by using the /a switch, try the next method to determine the source of the problem.\nMethod 3: Delete the Word Data registry subkey\nMost of the frequently used options in Word are stored in the Word Data registry subkey. A common troubleshooting step is to delete the Word Data registry subkey. When you restart Word, the program rebuilds the Word Data registry key by using the default settings.\nNOTE:\nWhen you delete the Word Data registry subkey, Word resets several options to their default settings. For example, Word resets the \"most recently used file\" list on the File menu. Also, Word resets many settings that you customize in the Options popup window.\nIMPORTANT:\nFollow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it,\nback up the registry\nin case there are problems and you need to restore it later.\nTo delete the Word Data registry subkey, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nType \"regedit\" in the\nSearch\nbox  and then press Enter.\nLocate the following registry subkey, as appropriate for the version of Word that you are using:\nWord 2016: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Word\\Data\nWord 2013: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\\Word\\Data\nWord 2010: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\14.0\\Word\\Data\nWord 2007: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Word\\Data\nWord 2003: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\Word\\Data\nClick\nData\n, and then click\nFile > Export\n.\nName the file \"Wddata.reg\", and then save the file to the desktop.\nClick\nEdit > Delete\n, then click\nYes\n.\nExit the Registry Editor and start Word.\nIf Word starts and works correctly, you have resolved the problem (a damaged Word Data registry key). You may now have to change several settings to restore your favorite options in Word.\nIf the problem is not resolved, restore the original Word Data registry subkey, and then try the next method below.\nRestore the original Word Data registry key\nTo restore the original Word Data registry subkey, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nDouble-click the\nWddata.reg\nicon on the desktop.\nClick\nYes\n, and then click\nOK\n.\nIf restoring the Word Data registry subkey doesn’t work, go to the next procedure.\nMethod 4: Delete the Word Options registry key\nThe Word Options registry key stores options that you can set in Word. These settings are divided into default and optional groups. Default settings are created during the program setup. Optional settings are not created during setup. You can change both the default and optional settings in Word.\nTo delete the Word Options registry key, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nType regedit in the Search box (in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 8) or in the Start Search box on the Start menu (in earlier versions of Windows), and then press Enter.\nLocate the following registry subkey, as appropriate for the version of Word that you are running:\nWord 2016: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Word\\Options\nWord 2013: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\\Word\\Options\nWord 2010: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\14.0\\Word\\Options\nWord 2007: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Word\\Options\nWord 2003: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\Word\\Options\nClick\nOptions\n, and then click\nFile > Export\n.\nName the file \"Wddata.reg\", and then save the file to the desktop.\nClick\nEdit > Delete\n, then click\nYes\n.\nExit the Registry Editor and start Word.\nIf Word starts and works correctly, you have resolved the problem (a damaged Word Options registry key). You may now have to change several settings to restore your favorite options in Word.\nIf the problem is not resolved, restore the original Word Options registry key, and then try the next method.\nTo restore the original Word Options registry key\nTo restore the original Word Options registry subkey, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nDouble-click the\nWdoptn.reg\nicon on the desktop.\nClick\nYes\n, and then click\nOK\n.\nMethod 5: Replace the Normal.dot or Normal.dotm global template file\nYou can prevent formatting, AutoText, and macros that are stored in the global template file from affecting the behavior of Word and any documents that you open. To do this, replace the global template file.\nIMPORTANT:\nThis method includes renaming the global template file so that Word does not find it as expected when it restarts. This forces Word to re-create the global template file. By doing this, you save the original file in case you have to restore it. Be aware that when you rename the global template file, several settings are reset to their defaults, including custom styles, custom toolbars, macros, and AutoText entries. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you save the global template file and do not delete it.\nADDITIONAL NOTE:\nIn certain situations, you may have more than one global template file. For example, this occurs if multiple versions of Word are running on the same computer, or if several workstation installations exist on the same computer. In these situations, make sure that you rename each global template file so that it clearly reflects the appropriate Word installation.\nTo rename the global template file, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nClick\nStart > Search\n, type \"cmd\", and then press Enter.\nAt the command prompt, type the command that corresponds to your version of Word:\nWord 2016, Word 2013, Word 2010, or Word 2007:\n\"ren %userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\Normal.dotm OldNormal.dotm\"\nWord 2003:\n\"ren %userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\Normal.dot OldNormal.dot\"\nPress Enter.\nAt the command prompt, type \"exit\" and press Enter.\nStart Word.\nIf Word starts correctly, you have resolved the problem. In this case, the problem is a damaged global template file. Now, you may have to change several settings to restore your favorite options.\nNOTE:\nThe old global template file may contain customizations that can't be easily re-created. These customizations may include styles, macros, and AutoText entries. In this case, you may be able to copy the customizations from the old global template file to the new global template file by using the Organizer. For more information about how to use the Organizer to copy macros and styles, press F1 in Word to open Microsoft Word Help, type \"rename macros\" in the\nSearch\nfield, and then click\nSearch\nto view the topic.\nIf the problem is not resolved, restore the original global template file, and then go to the next section.\nRestore the original global template file\nTo restore the original global template file, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nClick\nStart > Search\n, type \"cmd\", and then press Enter.\nAt the command prompt, type the command that corresponds to your version of Word:\nWord 2016, Word 2013, Word 2010, or Word 2007:\n\"ren %userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\Normal.dotm OldNormal.dotm\"\nWord 2003:\n\"ren %userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\Normal.dot OldNormal.dot\"\nPress Enter.\nAt the command prompt, type \"exit\" and press Enter.\nStart Word.\nMethod 6: Disable the Startup folder add-ins\nWhen you start Word, Word automatically loads templates and add-ins that are located in the Startup folders. Conflicts or problems that affect an add-in can cause problems in Word. To determine whether an item in a Startup folder is causing the problem, temporarily disable the registry setting that points to these add-ins.\nTo do this, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nStart Windows Explorer, type \"windows ex\" in the\nSearch\nfield, and then press Enter.\nAt the command prompt, type the command that corresponds to your version of Word:\nWord 2016, 64-bit C2R installation: \"%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\root\\office16\\Startup\\\"\nWord 2016, 32-bit C2R installation: \"%programfiles% (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\root\\office16\\Startup\\\"\nWord 2016, 64-bit MSI installation: \"%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\office16\\Startup\\\"\nWord 2016, 32-bit MSI installation: \"%programfiles% (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\office16\\Startup\\\"\nWord 2013, 64-bit C2R installation: \"%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\root\\office15\\Startup\\\"\nWord 2013, 32-bit C2R installation: \"%programfiles% (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\root\\office15\\Startup\\\"\nWord 2013, 64-bit MSI installation: \"%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\office15\\Startup\\\"\nWord 2013, 32-bit MSI installation: \" %programfiles% (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\office15\\Startup\\\"\nWord 2010: \"%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\Office14\\Startup\\\"\nWord 2007: \"%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\Office12\\Startup\\\"\nWord 2003: \"%programfiles%\\Microsoft\\Office\\Office11\\Startup\\\"\nPress Enter.\nRight-click one of the files that is contained in the folder, and then click\nRename\n.\nAfter the file name, type .old, and then press Enter.\nIMPORTANT:\nImportant Make a note of the original file name so that you can restore the file, if it is necessary.\nStart Word.\nIf you can no longer reproduce the problem, you have found the specific add-in that causes the problem. If you must have the features that the add-in provides, contact the vendor of the add-in for an update.\nIf the problem is not resolved, rename the add-in by using its original name, and then repeat steps 3 through 6 for each file in the Startup folder.\nIf you can still reproduce the problem, type the following path in the address bar of Windows Explorer, and then click\nOK\n.\nWindows 10, 8.1, 8, or 7: \"%userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Word\\Startup\"\nWindows XP: \"%userprofile%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Word\\Startup\"\nRepeat steps 3 through 6 for each file in this\nStartup\nfolder.\nIf the problem is not resolved after you disable the Startup folder add-ins, go to the next method.\nMethod 7: Delete the COM add-ins registry keys\nYou can install COM add-ins in any location. Programs that interact with Word install COM add-ins. To determine whether a COM add-in is causing the problem, temporarily disable the COM add-ins by deleting the registry keys for the COM add-ins.\nTo delete the COM add-ins registry keys, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nClick\nStart < Search\n, type \"regedit\", and then press Enter.\nLocate this registry subkey: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\Word\\Addins.\nClick\nAdd ins\n, and then click\nFile > Export\n.\nName the file \"WdaddinHKCU.reg\", and then save the file to the desktop.\nClick\nEdit > Delete\n, and then click\nYes\n.\nLocate this registry subkey: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\Word\\Addins\nClick\nAdd ins\n, and then click\nFile > Export\n.\nName the file \"WdaddinHKLM.reg\", and then save the file to the desktop.\nClick\nEdit > Delete\n, and then click\nYes\n.\nExit the Registry Editor and Start Word.\nIf the problem is resolved, you have determined that a COM add-in program is causing the problem. Next, you must determine which COM add-in program is causing the problem.\nDetermine which COM add-in program is causing the problem\nTo determine which COM add-in program is causing the problem, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nDouble-click the\nWdaddin.reg\nicon on your desktop.\nClick\nYes,\nand then click\nOK\n.\nIf you're using Word 2016, Word 2013, or Word 2010:\nClick\nFile > Options.\nClick\nAdd-Ins\n.\nIn the\nManage\nlist, click\nCOM Add-Ins\n, and then click\nGo\n.\nNOTE:\nIf an add-in is listed in the COM Add-Ins popup window, uncheck the\nadd-in\nbox. If more than one add-in is listed, uncheck only one add-in box at a time. This procedure helps determine which add-in is causing the problem.\nClick\nOK\nto close the COM Add-Ins popup window.\nClick\nFile > Exit.\nIf you're using Word 2007:\nClick the\nMicrosoft Office\nbutton, and then click\nWord Options.\nClick\nAdd-ins\n.\nIn the\nManage\nlist, click\nCOM Add-Ins\n, and then click\nGo\n.\nNOTE:\nIf an add-in is listed in the COM Add-Ins popup window, uncheck the\nadd-in\nbox. If more than one add-in is listed, uncheck only one add-in box at a time. This procedure helps determine which add-in is causing the problem.\nClick\nOK\nto close the COM Add-Ins popup window.\nClick the\nMicrosoft Office\nbutton, and then click\nExit Word\n.\nClick\nFile > Exit.\nStart Word.\nIf the problem is resolved when you start Word, you have determined which COM add-in is causing the problem. If you must have the features that the add-in provides, you must determine which add-in includes those features so that you can contact the vendor for an update.\nIf the problem is not resolved when you start Word, repeat steps 4 and 5 for each COM add-in that's listed until you determine which add-in is causing the problem.\nTo restore the COM add-ins, repeat step 4, but select the check box for each COM add-in that you want to restore.\nMethod 8: Change the default printer\nTo change the default printer, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nClick\nStart < Search\n, type \"regedit\", and then press Enter.\nRight-click\nMicrosoft XPS Document Writer\n, and then click\nSet as default printer\n.\nStart Word.\nIf the problem is resolved after you start Word, you have determined that the printer is causing the problem. If this is the case, contact the vendor to see whether there is an update for the printer driver.\nMicrosoft Support options\nIf you can't resolve this problem, you can use Microsoft Support to search the Microsoft Knowledge Base and other technical resources for answers.

Months","summary":"A vulnerability in Microsoft Word was exploited by hackers for months before it was patched. Microsoft was notified of the flaw in October 2016, but waited until April 2017 to release a fix, allowing time for hackers to discover and exploit the bug.","raw_content":"Hackers used Microsoft Word bug 'for months' - BBC News\nImage caption,\nThe bug was found in Microsoft Office software - and went unfixed for months\nA bug in Microsoft Word was exploited by hackers for months before it was eventually fixed, according to security researchers.\nThe flaw allowed attackers to take control of a computer via malicious document files.\nThe zero-day, or previously undetected, vulnerability was patched earlier this month.\nHowever, it has since emerged that Microsoft was told about it in October, nearly six months ago.\nA report\nfrom the Reuters news agency\n,\nexternal\nnotes that security researcher Ryan Hanson at Optiv first discovered the problem in July 2016.\nMicrosoft could have notified customers to make a change to settings in Word that would have prevented the vulnerability from being exploited - but that would also have alerted hackers to its existence.\nThe decision to wait for a patch seems to have allowed a window of opportunity for hackers to discover the flaw on their own.\nHackathon\nIn March, cyber-security company FireEye noticed financial hacking software that was being distributed with the Microsoft bug.\nAnd another company, McAfee, found attacks that were exploiting it, too.\nMcAfee faced some criticism, however, for publishing a blog post about the vulnerability - with details hackers may have found useful - two days before it was fixed.\nYet another company, Proofpoint, found that the vulnerability was being targeted by scammers\ntrying to distribute Dridex malware\n- which infects a victim's computer before snooping on banking logins.\nImage source,\nAFP\nImage caption,\nScammers were caught trying to infect people's computers with malware via the vulnerability\nThere were even reports of hacking after the patch was made available.\nCyber-security outlet Morphisec said that employees at Ben-Gurion University in Israel had had their email accounts compromised by attackers who had then sent infected documents to medical professionals and contacts at technology companies.\n\"Prior to public disclosure, our engineers were aware of a small number of attempts to use this vulnerability through targeted spam designed to convince users to open a malicious attachment,\" a Microsoft spokesman said.\nCustomers who applied the 11 April security update were already protected, he added.\n\"In an ideal world, it would have been fixed sooner,\" said cyber-security expert Graham Cluley.\nHowever, he pointed out that patching software run on millions of computers around the world was not an easy process.\n\"There's always this huge challenge because companies want to patch their software, but they want to do it properly - they want to make sure they've been comprehensive with the fix,\" he told the BBC.\nMore on this

While we continue to recommend against using automated Microsoft updates, a manual update will cure this issue.\n— August 8, 2023\nMicrosoft’s Word update Version 2208 (Build 15601.20088) released on August 31 contains at least one major bug that interrupts high-speed repetitive functions, specifically including the Sets feature in our programs along with some native Word features.\nMicrosoft is aware of the issue; it is already fielding complaints from others of its customers.\nTHERE IS AN IMPORTANT UPDATE EDIT BELOW. Please read it before taking any action.\nUntil Microsoft distributes a patch:\nWe have one report that updating Word once, then repeatedly rebooting (2-3 times) your computer may solve the issue.If you try this approach and it works, please let us know.\nWe can recommend this workaround developed by Ariel Torres of\nInnerPC\nand brought to our attention by Paul Bartlett, who reports “it works like a charm.” It is reported by our customers to have worked 100% of the time.\nAriel’s article addresses a different bug in the same update, so the descriptions of the issues and their rollback date are different. That’s OK, ignore the differences. Concentrate on the process. We strongly recommend you carefully read through Ariel’s entire article and suggest you watch the video at the end, the video more for context than for it’s directions, before doing anything. Then follow the article one careful step at a time. The entire process requires just a few minutes, but precision is key. It’s not a time to rush.\nThis is critically important: You are updating Word. Before doing so make sure you’ve made “keep safe” backup copies of theformtool folder—normal location is at %appdata%>Roaming—and the program itself in Word’s Startup folder—normal location is at %appdata%>Roaming>Microsoft>Word—before doing the roll back.\nJust in case. After all, what can go wrong?\nHere’s a link to Ariel’s article:\nHow to Revert Office 365 to a Previous Version\nWe recommend that for the “TargetVersion” use\n16.0.15225.20204\n. That will roll Office back to its May 24th version, which seems to include substantial improvements, while the troublesome September 13th version does not. You can view Microsoft’s version descriptions\nhere\n.\nDownload the two programs the article calls for by clicking\nhere\n.\nWe’ve prebuilt the config.xml for you so that its TargetVersion already points to 16.0.15225.20204, so you can skip step #3 in Ariel’s instructions.\nMost importantly, turn off the automated update system. Let a month or two pass for most Office updates unless there is a serious security issue. These update bugs happen and they cause serious disruptions. You don’t need to be a victim!\nFinally, if you prefer, our Service Desk will do the roll back for you as part of its fee-based\nCustom\nCall\nservice.\nWe’d like to thank several customers for their assistance troubleshooting the issue and helping to create a workaround: Paul Bartlett, Michael Burnstein, Helaena Eichberg, Danette Lilja, and especially Marie Stockton, who gave up a good part of her Sunday for repeatedly testing our suggestions until we found the one that worked. We cheered your contributions last night in the office. Thank you!\nIMPORTANT UPDATE EDIT:\nHere are the relevant instructions, proven to work 100%, for using the\nTFT Rollback Package\n:\nDrop the folder contents of the zip folder (2 files) into a new folder at the C:\\ level named “Office Install”\nExtract the files from Office Deployment Tool (officedeploymenttool_15601-20148) by clicking on it. Make sure the contents remain in Office Install.\nClose all Office programs, like Word, Excel, Outlook, etc.\nIf you are on a server, advise the other users of the server to close all Office programs as well.\nOpen cmd prompt (if necessary, search for “cmd prompt”) as administrator\ntype the below:\ncd C:\\Office Install\n(space after cd and space between Office and Install)\nand press Enter.\nThen type\nsetup.exe /configure config.xml\n(there is a space after exe and a space after configure)\nand press Enter.\nAn Office box will show briefly and disappear. You can close the cmd prompt once it closes.\nNext, open Word and go to Account > Office Updates. Click Update Now.\nWait a five minutes, then reboot your computer.\nYou should be done.\nWhen it has restarted, open Word again and go back to Office Updates. Check to see that you have the targeted update.\nAt TFT we’re divided whether to recommend always selecting the DISABLE UPDATES to prevent issues like this, or using Office’s semi-annual update setting, then manually checking for important updates as needed.

Get the full Microsoft Office suite for life for just $72.\nFortunately, the bug is limited to version 2409, occurs with capitalized file extension names, and happens when you’re prompted to save upon closing Word (not when you manually save).\nYou May Also Like\nSo that narrows down the issue quite a bit. But it's still pretty bad for the unlucky users whose files are deleted when they're trying to do the exact opposite.

And in July a massive\noutage\nfrom\nCrowdStrike,\nwhich provides antivirus software to Microsoft, took down millions of Windows devices and caused global disruption for a few days.\nMicrosoft is currently investigating the issue. But until there's a fix, a few different workarounds are recommended. First, if your file was deleted, it may have gone to the recycle bin, so you should try to find it there. To mitigate any future problems, manually save documents before closing to avoid triggering the save prompt, which is when files may be deleted. \"Our current tests show the issue occurs after saving when prompted on clicking X to close Word. It does not currently reproduce when manually saving before close,\" said Microsoft.\nYou can also disable the Backstage option to prevent possibly triggering the bug. Do this by going to File > Options > Save then \"Don’t show the Backstage when opening or saving files with keyboard shortcuts.\"\nLast but not least, you can also revert back to an older version of Microsoft 365 until the bug is fixed.\nTopics\nApps & Software\nMicrosoft\nCecily Mauran\nTech Reporter\nCecily is a tech reporter at Mashable who covers AI, Apple, and emerging tech trends.

Please try!\nHi friends,\nSo I've been having that really annoying MSWord problem. You start typing, and the words seemingly disappear, go all glitchy, new letters will appear, paragraphs will merge, random crap appears below/above etc... Here's\nhow it looked\n(although it got much worse for me). It was driving me insane. For reference. I have Windows 11, 12700k CPU, and 3060ti. So it can't be a hardware issue. All drivers/BIOS/etc., are updated. So no dramas on that front.\nI tried finding a solution online recommended by the help forums:\nI tried disabling hardware acceleration via a registry edit. No help.\nI tried unchecking that orphan paragraph thing in themes. No help.\nI tried reinstalling Office. No help.\nI tried doing the \"online fix\" for Office. It fixed it for about 15mins, and then the glitch would start again after the entire document would do this kind of flash... Not sure what that is.\nBut then I found a solution, after\na lot\nof experimenting with settings that may mess with graphical interfacing. You want to go to the following: \"icons\" version of Control Panel (find this in the top right as a drop-down in control panel) --> ease of access centre --> make this computer easier to see --> uncheck the box \"disable unnecessary animations\".\nHere's where you'll find it.\nNow MS Word is working perfectly. No glitches. Just smooth smooth typing without it turning into a jumbled mess or disappearing text!\nHi, making an edit four months later. For some, turning off unnecessary animations does a partial job of fixing the issue. Here are some other things that you can try to fix (all verified through my friends having the same issue):\nReinstalling fonts.\nDelete fonts by searching \"font\" in the Windows menu, which will take you to the control panel section controlling fonts. Delete all fonts. Then download all your most used fonts and install them.\nPut \"DisableHardwareAcceleration\" dword with value of \"1\" in the following registry pathway.\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\Common\\Graphics] OR  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Common\\Graphics]. If \"graphics\" is missing, create it by right-clicking and selecting \"make new string\". Warning, this is registry editing. Make sure you exercise all due diligence when messing around with this aspect of your PC.\nIncrease the width of your blinking cursor.\nUnder, \"Make thee computer easier to see\", find the \"Set the thickness of the blinking cursor\" set it to \"2\" instead of the default \"1\".\nInstalling the studio version of your video driver.\nFor NVidia users, this can be done through NVidia G-force Experience.  Go to the top right corner, next to \"check for updates\" there are three dots. Click them. Change preference to studio driver. Warning, this may trigger a rollback or a new download. It may also cause a very slight decrease in graphics performance on the latest gaming titles. This comes at the price of stability. I don't know how to do this for AMD, but I assume it's a similar process (Google is your friend!).\nIf you're like me and have tried everything short of an OS re-install recommended on the Microsoft Help Forums, give this a go. Hopefully, it does the trick!\nThis can be of benefit to someone.

Here is the problem; When I start with a new document, if I type and finish the first page and while going to the second page by clicking the enter, its redirects to the first page itself like I am not able to type or do anything in the second page unless I am inserting a blank page. This is the same happening when I copy big documents and paste them on the first page; it does not show the second page. But this copied text is still showing when I change to read mode or web layout. Is there a solution?\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Word | For home | Windows\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Word | For home | Windows\nA family of Microsoft word processing software products for creating web, email, and print documents.\nSign in to follow\nLocked Question.\nThis question was migrated from the Microsoft Support Community.

Press Play: highlighting and reading should proceed from the cursor position, but nothing happens.\n(Advanced) Download and unzip the\nClaro Support Toolkit\n.\nClose Word. From the toolkit run the program “WordTest.exe”, which will show a diagnostic report. Then start Word, type some text, and go back to the toolkit and double-click to run “WordCOMTest.vbs”, which should display the text in the Word document. If either of these steps indicates a problem, then the fixes on this page should help you. If not, please contact Claro Support for more assistance.\nFor Office 2019, Office 2021 and Office 365\nSelect your Microsoft Office version in the programs list:\nSelect “Change” from the options at the top.\nThe Office installation window should now give you an option to repair. First select ‘Quick repair’ and ‘Repair’, then follow the instructions:\nIf this does not resolve the problem, repeat the above procedure but this time perform an ‘Online repair’\nIf Repair does not work\nIf the Detect and Repair process does not work then the next best step is to reinstall Microsoft Office. If you are technical, however, you can try one of the following fixes:\nDelete the normal.dot or normal.dotm document template.\nClose Word.\nOpen Windows Explorer.\nTurn on “Show hidden files, folder and drives”.\nGo to:\n“C:\\Users\\[your username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates”\nDelete normal.dotm\nRestart Word.\nWord may need to re-register with Windows. To do this you will need to open the run command.\nTo do this: Click Start and type ‘run’ in the search box, this should bring up the Run shortcut, click on it.\nDepending on your version of office type the following into the run command. If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows, replace “\\Program Files\\” with “\\Program Files (x86)\\” \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\WINWORD.EXE\" /r\nClose ClaroRead.\nClick on Start, All Programs, Claro Software, and right-click on the ClaroRead shortcut.\nSelect “Run as Administrator”. If this does not work, try doing the same for Microsoft Word, and finally for both. ClaroRead does not need to be run as an administrator but permissions can be confused on a machine so one or both of ClaroRead and Word need to be run elevated. If you find this is the case, try the following steps:\nNavigate to Microsoft Word, usually in Program Files, Microsoft Office, Officexx, and called winword.exe. Right-click on winword.exe and select Properties. Open the Security tab.\nNavigate to ClaroRead, usually in Program Files, Claro Software, ClaroRead, and called ClaroRead.exe. Right-click on ClaroRead.exe and select Properties. Open the Security tab.\nCheck that the “Group or User names” list is the same for each program. For each entry in the list check that the Permissions list has the same settings for Allow and Deny.\nChange the “Read” and “Read & Execute” entries for ClaroRead (or Word) so they are the same.\nCheck your network administrator, if you have one: has anything in Microsoft Word been disabled, for example in the Group Policy Editor or Group Policy Management Console?\nThe Windows Registry contains keys that must all correctly reference your installation of Microsoft Word. Repairing Microsoft Word may fix your installation of Word but may leave intact erroneous keys – for example, keys from a different version of Word that are not referenced by your current version. One key we have discovered is HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT > TypeLib > {00020905-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}. Child keys of this key reference a special file in Word, the MSWORD.OLB file. If you have any child keys in here that reference a wrong or missing MSWORD.OLB file, then ClaroRead will not speak correctly in Word. You can do two things to fix these MSWORD.OLB references:\nSearch through the child keys of {00020905-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} for any references to an MSWORD.OLB file that is not part of your current installation, or is not actually where it says it is on the computer. For example, if you find a child key that references C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\Root\\Office16\\MSWORD.OLB (the Word 2016 file) but you have Word 2013 installed, then you should delete the child key.\nYou may also need to add back in the correct reference to the current MSWORD.OLB. You are probably best to use the Office repair operations detailed above. Alternatively, visit the\nMicrosoft Support\nwebsite to get additional information/support how to fix this issue.\nRun Word in Safe Mode\nso Add-ins and Extensions are disabled. If it then works this may be indicative of a conflict with an Add-in. Disable Add-ins in Word.\nUse Task Manager to check for instances of winword.exe – when ClaroRead is running there should be two. Close Word and ClaroRead and then check in Task Manager and terminate any other instances.

If the document is damaged, you may be able to retrieve the text of the document if you can omit this final paragraph mark.\nTo access a document but leave its final paragraph mark behind, follow these steps:\nOn the\nFile\nmenu, select\nNew\nand then select\nBlank Document\n.\nOn the\nInsert tab\n, select\nObject\nin the\nText\ngroup, and then select\nText from File\n.\nSelect the file that you want to open and insert, and then select\nInsert\n.\nOption 2: Start Word by using the /a switch\nThe /a (\"administrative installation\") switch is a troubleshooting tool that is used to determine where a problem may exist in Word. The /a switch prevents add-ins and global templates from being loaded automatically. The /a switch also locks the settings files to prevent it from being read or modified. To start Word by using the /a switch, follow these steps:\nType\nRun\nin the\nSearch\nbox (in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 8) or in the\nStart Search\nbox on the\nStart\nmenu (in earlier versions of Windows), and then press\nEnter\n.\nIn the\nRun\ndialog box, type\nwinword /a\n, and then press\nEnter\n.\nFor more information about the /a switch, see the following Knowledge Base article:\n826857\n\"Description of the \"/a\" startup switch in Word.\"\nIf the problem does not occur when you start Word by using the /a switch, try the next option.\nOption 3: Delete the Word Data registry subkey\nMost of the frequently used options in Word are stored in the Word Data registry subkey. A common troubleshooting step is to delete the Word Data registry subkey. When you restart Word, the program rebuilds the Word Data registry subkey by using the default settings.\nNote\nWhen you delete the Word Data registry subkey, Word resets several options to their default settings. For example, Word resets the \"most recently used file\" list on the\nFile\nmenu. Also, Word resets many of the settings that you may have customized in the\nOptions\ndialog box.\nImportant\nFollow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it,\nback up the registry for restoration\nin case problems occur.\nTo delete the Word Data registry subkey, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nType\nregedit\nin the\nSearch\nbox (in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 8) or in the\nStart Search\nbox on the\nStart\nmenu (in earlier versions of Windows), and then press\nEnter\n.\nLocate the following registry subkey, as appropriate for the version of Word that you are using.\nWord version\nRegistry\nWord 2016 or later\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Word\\Data\nWord 2013\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\\Word\\Data\nWord 2010\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\14.0\\Word\\Data\nWord 2007\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Word\\Data\nWord 2003\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\Word\\Data\nSelect\nData\n, and then select\nExport\non the\nFile\nmenu.\nName the file Wddata.reg, and then save the file to the desktop.\nOn the\nEdit\nmenu, select\nDelete\n, and then select\nYes\n.\nExit Registry Editor.\nStart Word.\nIf Word starts and works correctly, you have resolved the problem (a damaged Word Data registry key).

These settings are divided into default and optional groups. Default settings are created during the program setup. Optional settings are not created during setup. You can change both the default and optional settings in Word.\nTo delete the Word Options registry key, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nType\nregedit\nin the\nSearch\nbox (in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 8) or in the\nStart Search\nbox on the\nStart\nmenu (in earlier versions of Windows), and then press\nEnter\n.\nLocate the following registry subkey, as appropriate for the version of Word that you are running.\nWord version\nRegistry\nWord 2016 or later\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Word\\Options\nWord 2013\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\\Word\\Options\nWord 2010\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\14.0\\Word\\Options\nWord 2007\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Word\\Options\nWord 2003\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\Word\\Options\nSelect\nOptions\n, and then on the\nFile\nmenu select\nExport\n.\nName the file Wddata.reg, and then save the file to the desktop.\nOn the\nEdit\nmenu, select\nDelete\n, and then select\nYes\n.\nExit Registry Editor.\nStart Word.\nIf Word starts and works correctly, you have resolved the problem (a damaged Word Options registry key).

To do this, replace the global template file.\nImportant\nThis Option includes renaming the global template file so that Word does not find it as expected when it restarts. This forces Word to re-create the global template file. By doing this, you save the original file in case you have to restore it. Be aware that when you rename the global template file, several settings are reset to their default values, including custom styles, custom toolbars, macros, and AutoText entries.\nTherefore, we strongly recommend that you save the global template file and do not delete it.\nAdditionally, in certain situations, you may have more than one global template file. For example, this occurs if multiple versions of Word are running on the same computer, or if several workstation installations exist on the same computer. In these situations, make sure that you rename each global template file so that it clearly reflects the appropriate Word installation.\nTo rename the global template file, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nType\ncmd\nin the\nSearch\nbox (in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 8) or in the\nStart Search\nbox on the\nStart\nmenu (in earlier versions of Windows), and then press Enter.\nAt the command prompt, type the following command, as appropriate for the version of Word that you are running, and then press\nEnter\n:\nWord 2007 or later\nren %userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\Normal.dotm OldNormal.dotm\nWord 2003\nren %userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\Normal.dot OldNormal.dot\nAt the command prompt, type\nexit\n, and then press\nEnter\n.\nStart Word.\nIf Word starts correctly, you have resolved the problem (a damaged global template file). You may have to change several settings to restore your favorite options.\nNote\nThe old global template file may contain customizations that can't be easily re-created. These customizations may include styles, macros, and AutoText entries. In this case, you may be able to copy the customizations from the old global template file to the new global template file by using the Organizer.\nFor more information about how to use the Organizer to copy macros and styles, press\nF1\nin Word to open Microsoft Word Help, type\nrename macros\nin the\nSearch\nbox, and then select\nSearch\nto view the topic.\nIf the problem is not resolved, restore the original global template file (see below), and then go to the next option.\nRestore the original global template file\nTo restore the original global template file, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nType\ncmd\nin the\nSearch\nbox (in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 8) or in the\nStart Search\nbox on the\nStart\nmenu (in earlier versions of Windows), and then press\nEnter\n.\nAt the command prompt, type the following command, as appropriate for the version of Word that you are running, and then press\nEnter\n:\nWord 2007 or later\nren %userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\OldNormal.dotm Normal.dotm\nWord 2003\nren %userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\OldNormal.dot Normal.dot\nType\nexit\n, and then press\nEnter\n.\nStart Word.\nOption 6: Disable the Startup folder add-ins\nWhen you start Word, Word automatically loads templates and add-ins that are located in the Startup folders. Conflicts or problems that affect an add-in can cause problems in Word. To determine whether an item in a Startup folder is causing the problem, temporarily disable the registry setting that points to these add-ins.\nTo do this, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nStart Windows Explorer. Type\nwindows ex\nin the\nSearch\nbox (in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 8) or in the\nStart Search\nbox on the\nStart\nmenu (in earlier versions of Windows), and then press\nEnter\n.\nType the following command in the address bar, as appropriate for the version of Word that you're running and its installation type, and then press\nEnter\n:\nWord version\nInstallation type\nPath\nWord 2016 or later\n64-bit C2R installation:\n%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\root\\office16\\Startup\\\n32-bit C2R installation:\n%programfiles% (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\root\\office16\\Startup\\\n64-bit MSI installation:\n%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\office16\\Startup|\n32-bit MSI installation:\n%programfiles% (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\office16\\Startup\\\nWord 2013\n64-bit C2R installation:\n%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\root\\office15\\Startup\\\n32-bit C2R installation:\n%programfiles% (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\root\\office15\\Startup\\\n64-bit MSI installation:\n%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\office15\\Startup\\\n32-bit MSI installation:\n%programfiles% (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\office15\\Startup\\\nWord 2010\n%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\Office14\\Startup\\\nWord 2007\n%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\Office12\\Startup\\\nWord 2003\n%programfiles%\\Microsoft\\Office\\Office11\\Startup\\\nRight-click one of the files in the folder, and then select\nRename\n.\nAfter the file name, type\n.old\n, and then press\nEnter\n.\nImportant\nMake a note of the original file name so that you can restore the file, if it becomes necessary.\nStart Word.\nIf you can no longer reproduce the problem, you have found the specific add-in that causes the problem. If you must have the features that the add-in provides, contact the vendor of the add-in for an update.\nIf the problem is not resolved, rename the add-in by using its original name, and then repeat steps 3 through 6 for each file in the Startup folder.\nIf you can still reproduce the problem, type the following path in the address bar of Windows Explorer, and then select\nOK\n.\nFor Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista\n%userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Word\\Startup\nFor Windows XP\n%userprofile%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Word\\Startup\nRepeat steps 3 through 6 for each file in this Startup folder.\nIf the problem is not resolved after you disable the Startup folder add-ins, go to the next option.\nOption 7: Delete the COM add-ins registry keys\nYou can install COM add-ins to any location. Programs that interact with Word install COM add-ins. To determine whether a COM add-in is causing the problem, temporarily disable the COM add-ins by deleting the registry keys for the COM add-ins.\nTo delete the COM add-ins registry keys, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nType\nregedit\nin the\nSearch\nbox (in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 8) or in the\nStart Search\nbox on the\nStart\nmenu (in earlier versions of Windows), and then press\nEnter\n.\nLocate the following registry subkey:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\Word\\Addins\nSelect\nAddins\n, and then select\nFile\n>\nExport\n.\nName the file WdaddinHKCU.reg, and then save the file to the desktop.\nOn the\nEdit\nmenu, select\nDelete\n, and then select\nYes\n.\nLocate the following registry subkey:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\Word\\Addins\nSelect\nAddins\n, and select\nFile\n>\nExport\n.\nName the file WdaddinHKLM.reg, and then save the file to the desktop.\nOn the\nEdit\nmenu, select\nDelete\n, and then select\nYes\n.\nExit Registry Editor.\nStart Word.\nIf the problem is resolved, you have determined that a COM add-in program is causing the problem. Next, you must determine which COM add-in program is causing the problem.\nDetermine which COM add-in program is causing the problem\nTo determine the problematic COM add-in program, follow these steps:\nExit all Office programs.\nDouble-click the\nWdaddin.reg\nicon on your desktop.\nSelect\nYes\n, and then select\nOK\n.\nUse one of the following procedures, as appropriate for the version of Word that you are running.\nWord 2010 or later\nOn the\nFile\nmenu, select\nOptions\n.\nSelect\nAdd-Ins\n.\nIn the\nManage\nlist, select\nCOM Add-Ins\n, and then select\nGo\n.\nNote\nIf an add-in is listed in the\nCOM Add-Ins\ndialog box, clear the add-in check box. If more than one add-in is listed, clear only one add-in check box at a time. This procedure helps you determine which add-in is causing the problem.\nSelect\nOK\nto close the COM Add-Ins dialog box.\nOn the\nFile\nmenu, select\nExit\n.\nWord 2007\nSelect the Microsoft Office button, and then select\nWord options\n.\nSelect\nAdd-ins\n.\nIn the\nManage\nlist, select\nCOM Add-ins\n, and then select\nGo\n.\nIf an add-in is listed in the\nCOM Add-Ins\ndialog box, clear the add-in check box.
