Troubleshooting steps include checking internet connection, disabling security settings, checking browser, and running Slack troubleshooter.","raw_content":"Fix: Can't Connect to Slack on Windows 10 - Technipages\nSkip to content\nSlack is a reliable collaboration platform that allows you to communicate with your colleagues and work on common tasks and projects. Unfortunately, the service is sometimes affected by\nvarious issues\n, and users cannot connect to Slack’s servers.\nMore specifically, connection and login issues are some of the most common glitches affecting Slack. In this guide, we’ll explore how you can quickly troubleshoot them and regain access to your workspaces.\nContents\n1\nFix: Cannot Connect to Slack on PC\n1.1\nCheck Your Connection\n1.2\nDisable Security Settings and Programs\n1.3\nCheck Your Browser\n1.4\nRun the Slack Troubleshooter\n1.5\nConclusion\nFix: Cannot Connect to Slack on PC\n⇒ Quick Notes\n:\nGo to\nwww.status.slack.com\nand check if there are any known issues or notes about scheduled maintenance tasks.\nAdditionally, run the\nSlack connection test\nand contact your network admin if you get any errors.\nEqually important, update your app and OS. To update Windows 10, go to\nSettings\n, select\nUpdate and Security\n, go to\nWindows Update\nand check for updates. Then click on your Slack desktop app menu, select\nHelp\n, and\nCheck for updates\n.\nCheck Your Connection\nMake sure your connection is stable, and you’re not experiencing any bandwidth issues. Here’s what you can do to improve your network connection:\nFirst, restart your router or unplug the device if you haven’t done that in a long time.\nWireless connections are more convenient, but they’re less stable compared to cable connections. If possible, switch to a cable connection or use a mobile hotspot and check the results.\nAdditionally, disconnect other devices using the connection to free up more bandwidth for Slack.\nDisable Security Settings and Programs\nYour antivirus and firewall might be interfering with Slack blocking your connection request. The same is valid for your proxy settings and VPN. Disable your antivirus, firewall, and VPN (if you’re using one).\nOn a side note,\nthe company confirmed\nthe following programs can interfere with Slack connections: Avira Browser Safety, Browser Guard, Pokki, Smart Panel, spyware and adware, Visual Discovery by Superfish, Avast, McAfee, Norton, AVG, and AdBlock Plus. If you’re using any of these programs, whitelist Slack or temporarily disable them.\nThen reset your network proxy settings:\nType\ninternet options\nin the Windows Search bar and double-click the first result.\nClick on the\nConnections tab\nand select\nLAN Settings\n.\nEnable\nAutomatically detect settings\n.\nDisable\nUse a proxy server\n.\nCheck the results. If the Slack connection issues persist, go back to\nInternet options\n, click on the\nAdvanced\ntab, and hit the\nReset\noption.\nCheck Your Browser\nIf the connection problems occur when you try to connect to Slask via your web browser, check your browser settings. Here’s what you need to do:\nEnable Incognito Mode\n. Launch a new browser tab in Incognito Mode and check if you can connect to Slack.\nClear the cache\n. Your\nbrowser cache\nmight be interfering with Slack’s scripts slowing down the connection, or even blocking it completely.\nDisable your extensions\n. The same is valid for your extensions, particularly adblockers and privacy extensions. Turn off all your extensions, refresh your browser and check the results.\nUpdate your browser\n. Makes sure you’re running the latest browser version on your computer. Outdated browser versions may sometimes cause connection issues.\nUse a different browser\n. Maybe your current browser is affected by unexpected temporary glitches preventing it from properly connecting to Slack and other web pages. Switch to a different browser and check if the issue is gone.\nKeep in mind that Slack supports the latest versions of the following browsers: Chrome (the only browser that supports Slack calls), Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.\nRun the Slack Troubleshooter\nSlack has a built-in troubleshooter that you can use to quickly optimize the app settings and automatically fix general issues.\nLaunch the Slack desktop app and click on the\nmenu\n(the three lines in the upper left-hand corner).\nThen navigate to\nHelp\nand select\nTroubleshooting\n.\nSelect\nClear Cache\nand restart. Check the results.\nIf the problem persists, reset app data.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, if you can’t connect to Slack, check the service status and make sure everything is up and running. Update the app, clear the cache, and disable your antivirus and firewall. If you’re using a VPN, disable it and check the results. Do you often experience Slack connection issues on your computer?

Also you can find a correct link if you open dev console in browser it should be in console output. If you copy this link to your clipboard (ctrl+c) and then you switch to your slack app. It seems like onFocus slack automatically reads the clipboard and process it if it's a link. That gets be logged in.\nShare\nImprove this answer\nFollow\nanswered\nMar 9, 2022 at 12:08\ndeathangel908\n9,827\n11\n11 gold badges\n54\n54 silver badges\n92\n92 bronze badges\n15 Comments\nAdd a comment\nDanh Mạnh\nDanh Mạnh\nOver a year ago\nIt worked on Kubuntu 21.10, you saved me !!\n2022-04-23T14:30:26.303Z+00:00\n8\nReply\nCopy link\nuser3049941\nuser3049941\nOver a year ago\nWorked for me just now, Kubuntu 22.04, I tried all the rest suggested here, nothing worked for me but this.\n2022-05-07T19:55:33.04Z+00:00\n7\nReply\nCopy link\nhjkatz\nhjkatz\nOver a year ago\nWorks for me Ubuntu 22.04 with KDE Plasma 5.24\n2022-05-10T19:37:12.027Z+00:00\n3\nReply\nCopy link\nTyler C\nTyler C\nOver a year ago\nWorked for me using Garuda Linux running Plasma 5.24.5\n2022-05-18T19:00:30.097Z+00:00\n3\nReply\nCopy link\nhijarian\nhijarian\nOver a year ago\nIt worked on Fedora Workstation 36 running Plasma 5.25.4, used Chrome and Slack 4.28.171 installed from the official RPM from the website.

However, once I reboot my computer, Slack fails to launch, crashing as soon as I try to launch it. Re-installing Slack gets it to launch again but once I reboot again, Slack stops launching properly. Google searching for crash log location gets me nothing so if anyone could help me find the logs and report the crashes, I'd really appreciate it.

Handling daily tasks can already be quite challenging, and it can become even more stressful when Slack stops working.\nDon’t worry, though. In this guide, you’ll learn how to fix the most common issues that you may encounter while using this app.\nRead on to get Slack working again!\nThe 12 Most Common Issues That Keep Slack from Working\nEvery day, thousands of people complain about not being able to communicate effectively with their team just because Slack is experiencing some sort of issue.\nIf that’s your case, don’t worry. Whether you’re experiencing crashing issues, frequent sign-outs, or even download problems, we’ve got you!\nIn this section, you’ll learn how to fix the 12 most common issues that may be keeping you from using Slack.\nWe’ve also prepared comprehensive guides that solve each specific issue separately. You can access them by clicking on the link provided in each section of the article.\nAre you ready? Let’s dive in!\n#1 Crashing Issues\nIf you can’t use Slack because it keeps crashing, there’s a good chance you’re using an incompatible browser.\nYou see,\nSlack is only compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. So, if you’re trying to use a different browser, say Internet Explorer, you’ll experience multiple issues.\nMake sure you’re using a compatible browser or download the app. Then, make sure your Internet connection is working correctly.\nIf it’s running slow, please\nrestart your modem and router by unplugging them, waiting for about 30–60 seconds, and plugging them back in.\nI also recommend fully closing the app or your browser and relaunching Slack again. Sometimes this quick action can get rid of corrupted files and temporary coding errors.\nRelaunching Slack is one of the easiest and most effective ways of solving crashing issues.\nRead our specialized guide on\nhow to stop Slack from crashing\nfor step-by-step instructions!\n#2 Launching Problems\nThere’s nothing more frustrating than not being able to open Slack, especially when you have an important meeting with your team.\nUnfortunately, this may happen if the app’s files become corrupted, damaged, or outdated. As a result, Slack may encounter different issues launching or performing routine tasks.\nI know this may sound concerning, but don’t worry!\nYou can easily solve the issue by clearing your cache from within the app’s settings or by uninstalling the app.\nIt’s also important to install any available updates and check your connection.\nAdditionally, there have been numerous complaints from users saying that Slack only opens in their browsers.\nIf that’s your case, please open your workspace menu and select “Open the Slack App”.\nFollow the steps shown in the image below to do it:\nLooking for other ways to solve the issue of\nSlack not launching\nor\nSlack only opening in your browser\n? Read our full detailed guides!\n#3 Frequent Sign-Outs\nIf Slack keeps logging you out, you need to make sure your browser or app is running on its latest version. If it’s not, please\ninstall any available updates.\nThen, enter\nfast.com\nand run an Internet speed test. If the results show that your connection is running slow, please\nrestart your modem and router, or\nuse an Ethernet connection\n.\nYou can also configure Slack to keep you signed in for a determined amount of time.\nTo do it, please select your work group’s name from the left area of your screen. Then go to Settings & Administration> Workspace settings > Authentication > Session Duration > Expand.\nBear in mind that you’ll only be able to modify the session duration settings if you’re the group’s host. If you’re not, try contacting the person who is and ask if they can do it for you.\nDon’t forget to check out our comprehensive guide on\nhow to stop Slack from logging you out\nfor step-by-step instructions.\n#4 Editing Issues\nNot being able to edit messages in Slack can be super frustrating. After all, we all make mistakes from time to time, and it’s only natural to want to correct them.\nUnfortunately, if the editing messages feature is disabled, and you’re not the group’s admin, you won’t be able to turn it on.\nBut, if you are, in fact, the group’s admin, you can easily enable this feature by clicking on your group’s name located on the left side of your screen. Then, click on Settings & Administration > Workspace Settings > Permissions > Message Editing & Deletion > Expand > Change the settings.\nIf you can’t edit your job title in Slack, make sure you’re using the desktop app or web version.\nThen, edit your profile.\nTo edit your job title in Slack, please open the desktop app or web version. Then, click on your icon and select “Profile”.\nStill\nstuck trying to edit messages\nor your\njob title in Slack\n? Take a look at our specialized guides for detailed instructions.\n#5 Red Dot Missing\nI know how annoying it can be when the red dot is missing on Slack, especially when you’re waiting for an important message.\nUnfortunately, many people find that the notification badge can disrupt focus, which is why Slack decided to change its color.\nBut, if you’re like me and prefer having the red dot, just\ngo to Slack’s desktop app, click on your profile picture, and select “Preferences”. Then, click on “Themes” and check the “Show colorful badges” box.\nIf the red dot is missing on your Slack, please edit your preferences.\nIf the issue persists, there’s a good chance you have to clear your cache or reinstall the app.\nRead our specialized\nguide on how to solve the issue of the\nred dot missing on Slack\nfor easy-to-follow instructions.\n#6 Drawing Feature Issue\nIf you can’t draw while sharing your screen on Slack, please\nmake sure you’re using the\ndesktop app\n, as this feature is only supported in that version.\nTo use the drawing feature, you need to share your entire screen.\nTo do it, just start a call, click on the “Share Screen” icon, and select “Entire Screen” or “Desktop”.\nIf you’re still unable to draw while sharing your screen, please install any available updates to get rid of the coding bug that is causing the issue.\nLearn other ways\nto solve the issue of\nSlack not letting you draw when sharing your screen\nby reading our detailed guide.\n#7 Download Problems\nIf Slack is not downloading your files, there’s a good chance you don’t have a good download speed.\nTry closing any other tabs or apps you’re not currently using, as they can interfere with your connection. And, don’t forget to restart your modem and router.\nIf the issue persists, chances are you’re searching for the file in a different location. That’s why, I recommend checking for your download location on Slack.\nTo do it, please\nopen the desktop app and click on your profile picture. Then, click on Preferences > Advanced > Download Location > Change.\nThen, download the file again and go to the default download location you previously selected to find it.\nIf you’re using Slack’s web version, you’ll also need to open your browser’s Privacy & Security settings and make sure the site is allowed to download multiple files.\nPlease take a look at our full guide for detailed instructions on how to solve the issue of\nSlack not downloading files.\n#8 Unread Messages Error\nIf Slack keeps saying you have unread messages, please mark all your conversations as read. To do it, open the desktop app, click on “More”, select “Unreads”, and click on “Mark All Messages Read”.\nYou can also mark all your messages as read by opening your workspace, pressing the Shift + Esc keys on your computer, and clicking on “Yes, Clear All!”.\nIf the issue persists, try installing any available updates and clearing your cache.\nSlack keeps saying there’s more unreads\n?

To solve the issue, please go to your device’s settings and edit your Date & Time or Location preferences.\nYou also need to\nmake sure your language & region on Slack are set to “Automatic”\n. Here’s how to do it on the desktop app:\nMake sure\nthe timezone is set to “Automatic”.\nDon’t forget to read our complete guide on how to\nstop Slack from changing your timezone\nfor detailed instructions.\n#10 Slack Unable to Find Microphone & Camera\nPeople often ask me how to help Slack find their camera and microphone. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can follow to make sure they’re properly recognized.\nFirst, you need to\nopen the desktop app and click on your profile picture. Then, click on “Preferences”, go to “Audio & Video”, and select the correct camera or microphone from the list.\nMake sure you’ve selected the right camera or microphone.\nIf Slack didn’t detect your camera and microphone, please make sure it’s allowed to access them in your device’s Privacy Settings menu.\nYou might also want to close other apps that may be using your microphone and camera in the background, and ensure your Bluetooth connection is turned off (if you’re using wireless earphones).\nTake a look at our comprehensive guide on\nhow to help Slack find your camera & microphone\nfor easy-to-follow instructions.\n#11 Sidebar Missing\nYou wouldn’t believe how many people I’ve seen complain about not being able to keep their sidebar always showing.\nIf that’s your case, don’t worry-we’ve got you covered!\nYou simply have to go to Slack, click on your profile picture, and open the Preferences menu. Then, click on “Sidebar” and uncheck the “Automatically close sidebar based on window size” box.\nIf that doesn’t work, please\ncheck Slack’s servers.\nIf they’re experiencing issues, you’ll need to wait for a couple of hours.\nWant to know more about\nhow to keep your Slack sidebar always showing?\nTake a look at our detailed guide!\n#12 Slack Asking for Updates\nIf Slack keeps asking to update, please look for any available updates.

connection.","raw_content":"Slack Keeps Crashing? Here's 8 Possible Causes To Check\nSlack Keeps Crashing? Here’s 8 Possible Causes To Check\nResearched & Written by\nGerry\nDoes your Slack keep crashing more often than a 5-year-old playing Mario Kart?\nI’m really sorry to hear that! I know how annoying it can be to try to communicate with your co-workers, only to keep facing one issue after another.\nDaily tasks can get stressful enough without your favorite communications platforms failing. What a disaster.\nBut don’t worry, you came here for answers, and you won’t leave without them. Below, you’ll find a list of several possible causes to address in order to fix the problem.\nThe 8 possible causes to look at when Slack keeps crashing are:\nAn incompatible browser\nAn outdated browser/Slack app\nA corrupted cache\nFailing servers\nCorrupted files\nA failing browser\nBrowser extensions\nA faulty internet connection\nRead on to stay in the loop!\n#1 An Incompatible Browser\nLet’s start off by making sure the browser you’re using is supported by Slack.\nThese days, most developers try their best to cover as many browsers as humanly possible, as this means more potential users. But, just like everything else on the market,\ncommunications platforms are a business, and browser compatibility development is not quick or cheap.\nThis is why most companies try to focus on the most popular browsers over those that are a little more\nniche.\nIt’s just a matter of efficient resource planning.\nNow, unless you’re playing it\nhipster\nand using a browser unknown to most of the world’s population, you should be ok. That being said, it can’t hurt to take a look at\nSlack’s list of supported browsers/operating systems\njust to be sure.\nSolution:\nIf your browser’s not compatible, try switching over to any of the alternatives on the list above to get things back to normal.\n#2 An Outdated Browser/Slack App\nWhile using the right browser should get rid of most issues, it’s also important to make sure you always keep everything updated.\nWhy? For two main reasons.\nNumber one, whenever a new version of Slack or your browser is released, it comes packed with new features, improvements on existing ones, and fixes for bugs.  And number two, because the oldest version of an app or browser stops being supported with every update.\nNow, something would have to be very wrong with your devices to keep you working on obsolete software. But sometimes a weak network or bugs can prevent automatic updating from doing its job.\nThis could easily explain why Slack keeps crashing, and might also cause other platforms, like\nAmazon Music to stop being able to download songs\nand work normally.\nIn cases like that, manually updating is the way to go.\nSolution:\nHere’s how you can go about this on Windows and Android devices. Once you have done this,\nmake sure your browser is also running on its latest available version\n.\nFor Windows:\nOpen the Slack App and click on the 3 horizontal lines in the upper-left corner of the window\nClick on “Help”\nSelect “Check for Updates” in the dropdown menu\nDoing this often can save you a lot of trouble\nIf there’s a newer version available, you’ll be asked if you want to install it. Agree and wait until the process is completed.\nFor iOS:\nOpen “App Store”\nLocate your profile button in the upper right corner of the screen, and tap on it\nFind the “Update All” button. This should update Slack if there’s a newer version available\nThis would be a good time to update any apps you have pending\nFor Android:\nGo to Play Store and click on your profile, located in the upper-right corner of your screen\nSelect “Manage apps & device”\nIf you just want to update Slack, select it and update it individually\nIf you want to update all pending apps, select “Update All”\nWait for the updating process to be completed\n#3 A Corrupted Cache\nMoving on, let’s check the app’s cache.\nIf you have got no idea what this is, don’t worry. There’s thousands of people all over the world in the same situation, so let me briefly explain it to you.\nYou can think of an app’s cache as a cheat sheet during an exam.\nIn there, you’ll find all the resources Slack needs to load quickly when launched, which is an advantage if, like me, you’re a little impatient.\nNormally, leaving your cache alone is for the best, as it provides a lot of advantages. But if it has accidentally stored a damaged file, it could explain why Slack keeps crashing. In that case, you’re better off clearing it.\nSolution:\nYou can do this within any operating system. To give you a general idea of the process, here’s how it goes on Android devices and Windows:\nFor Android:\nOn your device, go to “Settings”\nSelect “Apps”\nFrom the new menu, select “Apps” again\nFind Slack and select it\nFind “Storage” on the menu\nSelect “Clear Cache” from the available options\nFor Windows:\nClick on the three horizontal lines in the upper-left corner of the Slack app Window\nClick on Help>Troubleshooting>Clear Cache and Restart\nWhenever you suspect your cache is giving you trouble, try this and be amazed\nBelieve it or not, this simple process can make a night and day difference when it comes to how Slack performs.\n#4 Failing Servers\nWhat would be of the modern world without servers? A big mess, that’s what.\nDepending on your tech knowledge, you might have a clear idea of what these are, or you might have never heard the term before. If it’s the latter, please read on, it’s actually really simple.\nServers are massive storage units located in the headquarters of most companies.\nTheir main purpose is to save and back up data, manage user traffic, and make the user experience as enjoyable as possible.\nWithout them, all your favorite online platforms would constantly encounter several issues.\nGiven how essential they are to the internet’s daily operations, there are engineers all over the world who have been specifically tasked with improving on them frequently. And while they’ve done a terrific job so far, there’s still a long way to go before they can be considered bulletproof.\nFactors like\nblack-hat hackers\n, overheating, and coding bugs can greatly affect how they work and might be the reason Slack keeps crashing.\nSolution:\nTo confirm this as the source of your problems, we’ll have to check the real-time status of the platform’s servers.\nThis can be done in a matter of seconds with a couple of clicks:\nOpen the search engine and type\n“Is Slack Down?”\n, then hit Enter\nLocate “\nDowndetector\n” on the search results, and click on it (or click on this link:\nhttps://downdetector.com/status/slack/\n)\nMake sure you’re entering the official Downdetector website\nOnce you’ve entered the webpage, you’ll see a bunch of data, and a large graph\nLook out for narrow, mile-high spikes over wide, short mountains\nIf you see a series of user reports piling up in the graph above, it’s almost a certainty that the platform’s currently having trouble.\nHowever, although this might sound serious, it’s really not. IT engineers are highly trained to address situations like these in the blink of an eye.\nWorst-case scenario, Slack will be down for a maximum of 24 hours.\n#5 Corrupted Files\nIf nothing has worked so far, force-stopping the app just might.\nYou see, to work normally, our favorite apps and devices need thousands of background processes to run at the same time. They’re mostly invisible to us but make no mistake. They’re there.\nMore often than not, they run as expected and there’s nothing more to it.\nBut now and then, one or more can crash due to encountering a bug or a corrupted file, which might explain why Slack keeps crashing.\nIn cases like these, force-stopping and relaunching the app can patch things up and get everything back to normal.\nSolution:\nFor other platforms, I would simply recommend closing your browser and relaunching it, but since Slack has a feature to do this, let’s try things that way:\nFor Windows\n:\nOn the Slack app, click on the three horizontal lines located in the upper-left corner of the window\nSelect File>Quit Slack\nQuitting Slack this way allows all processes to be stopped correctly\nOnce you have done this, relaunch Slack and see if it keeps crashing.\n#6 A Failing Browser\nMore often than not, the previous step should work wonders. But\nif the source of the issue lies with your browser instead, closing and relaunching it would be the next best thing.\nJust as I explained before, in some cases, background processes can crash while running, causing Slack to act weird and keep failing.\nI would recommend trying the previous point first, and then resorting to your browser if you’re not successful.\n#7 Browser Extensions\nI know I’ve given you a lot to deal with, but don’t give up! We’re almost done.\nYet another reason why Slack might keep crashing is that one of your browser extensions is acting up. What are those, you may be asking? Well, let me shed some light on the concept.\nBrowser extensions are tools that make your experience much simpler and more enjoyable.\nThink of them as assistants that can help you do all sorts of things, from tracking Amazon Flash Sales, to translating webpages to your preferred language.\nMore often than not, extensions are a great thing to have installed, but sadly, not all of them work well with Slack. But don’t worry, there are very simple ways to test which ones are misbehaving and remove them if necessary.\nSolution:\nYou should be able to\nremove extensions in all the popular browsers\nout there, but for this example, I’ll show you the process for Google Chrome.\nBefore doing anything else, try launching the browser in Incognito Mode. This opens a version of it with all extensions disabled. Then, try using Slack and see if it keeps crashing.\nIf it does, then the issue likely lies elsewhere, but if it doesn’t, then extensions\nARE\nto blame, and here’s how to disable them:\nLaunch Chrome\nFind the three vertical dots in the top-right of the browser’s window\nClick on them, and then select More Tools>Extensions\nFind the extension(s) you want to remove, and then click on “Remove”\nConfirm if asked\nYou can do this extension by extension, or test until you’ve removed them all. It’s up to you.\n#8 A Faulty Connection\nLastly, let’s take a look at your connection status.\nAlthough Slack is not nearly as network-demanding as video or audio streaming platforms, it does need a stable internet connection to function.\nAnd while service drops will normally just cause you to stop receiving messages and files, sometimes an important resource can fail to load, causing the platform to keep crashing.\nWeak or failing networks are much trickier to diagnose than complete service failure, so it’s important you keep your eyes open. Issues like these can also affect other streaming platforms, like Amazon Music,\ncausing it to play audio at really low volumes\n.\nSolution:\nFirst, I’d try estimating your needs. As a general rule, I like to recommend that every person within a household has about 15-25 Mbps to go about their business.\nThis wiggle room allows for all sorts of activities, from texting to streaming in 4K without affecting other people’s connections.\nSo, if for example, you live with 3 other people, you’ll want an internet plan that offers\nAT LEAST\n100 Mbps.\nProvided that your current plan is already lightning-fast, then calling your provider should be your next move. Ask if they’re having coverage issues, and if their answer is no, then please reset your modem.\nNever done it before? No worries, here are some easy steps you can follow:\nWithout unplugging the modem, turn it around so that you can see the back of the unit\nLocate the reset button (more often than not, it’s not a button, but a small hole with a “\nReset”\nlabel on it)\nUse a paper clip or a thin toothpick to press down on the actual button inside this hole. Hold it down until all the lights at the front of the unit turn on, and then turn off\nFor a brief moment, all lights on the modem will be off, that’s your cue to stop holding down the reset button\nWait a couple of minutes and try using the platform. If your connection was to blame, Slack should no longer keep crashing.\nConclusion\nAll done!\nI bet that, when you first got here, you weren’t very hopeful about being able to tackle this situation yourself, but look at you now! Not only did you fix the problem, but also learned an Encyclopedia’s worth of tech knowledge.\nWin-win!\nRemember, although looking at an issue from all angles always helps, there are often some great starting points you can try. After all, you can never go wrong when relaunching your platforms and checking the status of their servers.\nThank you so much for sticking with me all the way to the end.

A hard reboot fixes it for a while. The issue is random and only occurs occasionally. I suspect a bug in the Slack app for linux. It appears to happen after an hour or two using a browser and then occurs as soon as I click into the Slack app..\nmarkhorrocks\n–\nmarkhorrocks\n2023-02-28 14:16:17 +00:00\nCommented\nFeb 28, 2023 at 14:16\n9\nGuys, I got it fixed without upgrading the kernel. Apparently the issue is with Slack that has been installed with Snap. Uninstall that and install it from official website or some other package manager.\ns.khan\n–\ns.khan\n2023-03-03 19:02:49 +00:00\nCommented\nMar 3, 2023 at 19:02\n3\nYes, uninstalling snap version and installing version from slack site solved it for me too. Thanks @s.khan! Now also drop-down menus are working well and they didn't work before.\nMilanG\n–\nMilanG\n2023-03-06 14:38:34 +00:00\nCommented\nMar 6, 2023 at 14:38\n3\nIt worked for me removing Slack for me $ sudo snap remove slack and then installing the .deb package downloaded from the website.

Leaks","summary":"The Slack app may crash due to uncaught exceptions or memory leaks in the app code. The post provides steps to debug uncaught exceptions and optimize memory usage to fix the issue.","raw_content":"| Slack Slack App Crashing\nSlack Slack App Crashing\nUncaught exceptions or memory leaks in the app code.\nUnderstanding Slack as a Tool\nSlack is a powerful chat and communication tool used by teams and organizations to facilitate seamless communication. It offers features such as channels, direct messaging, file sharing, and integrations with various other tools, making it a central hub for team collaboration.\nIdentifying the Symptom: Slack App Crashing\nOne common issue users might encounter is the Slack app crashing unexpectedly. This can disrupt communication and hinder productivity, especially if it occurs frequently.\nExploring the Issue: Uncaught Exceptions or Memory Leaks\nThe primary cause of the Slack app crashing could be uncaught exceptions or memory leaks within the app's code. Uncaught exceptions occur when the app encounters an error it cannot handle, leading to a crash. Memory leaks happen when the app consumes more memory than it releases, eventually exhausting available resources.\nUncaught Exceptions\nUncaught exceptions can arise from various sources, such as incorrect API calls or unexpected input data. These exceptions need to be handled gracefully to prevent the app from crashing.\nMemory Leaks\nMemory leaks can occur when objects are not properly disposed of, leading to increased memory usage over time. This can eventually cause the app to crash due to insufficient memory.\nSteps to Fix the Issue\nDebugging Uncaught Exceptions\nEnable detailed logging in your Slack app to capture error messages and stack traces. This will help identify the source of the exceptions.\nReview the logs to pinpoint the exact location and cause of the exceptions.\nImplement try-catch blocks around code segments that are prone to errors. For example:\ntry {\n// Code that might throw an exception\n} catch (Exception e) {\n// Handle the exception\nconsole.error('An error occurred:', e);\n}\nFor more information on handling exceptions, refer to the\nMDN Web Docs on Error Handling\n.\nOptimizing Memory Usage\nUse memory profiling tools to identify memory leaks. Tools like\nChrome DevTools\ncan help analyze memory usage.\nIdentify objects that are not being released and ensure they are properly disposed of when no longer needed.\nOptimize data structures and algorithms to reduce memory consumption.\nConclusion\nBy understanding the root causes of Slack app crashes, such as uncaught exceptions and memory leaks, and implementing the steps outlined above, you can enhance the stability and performance of your Slack application. For further reading, consider exploring the\nSlack API Documentation\nfor best practices and guidelines.\nTry DrDroid: AI Agent for Debugging\n80+ monitoring tool integrations\nLong term memory about your stack\nLocally run Mac App available\nThank you for your submission\nWe have sent the cheatsheet on your email!\nOops!

tips\nTroubleshoot Slack in a Citrix environment\nTroubleshoot Slack in a Citrix environment\nIf you're using Slack with Citrix and having trouble launching the desktop app, learn more about this problem and how to fix it.\nIssues launching Slack\nWhat's causing this problem\nCitrix environments, like XenApp and XenDesktop, use Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) redirection to route API calls that perform extra tasks before calling Windows operating system APIs.\nDue to an incompatibility between the Slack desktop app and Citrix's third-party DLLs, Slack may fail to load in Citrix environments.\nWhat you'll see when launching Slack\nThe Slack app will appear not to start after you attempt to launch it. However, if you open the task manager, you'll see\nslack.exe\nprocesses running. Slack may show up in the taskbar as well, but you won't be able to interact with the app.\nTypically, the app will finish launching after about 15 minutes and perform normally — but you'll see multiple reports of the\nslack.exe\nprocess crashing from that time period.\nExempt slack.exe from DLL hooking\nTo resolve problems launching the Slack app, you can exempt specific processes from your Citrix environment's DLL hooking mechanism. You can either\nadd registry values manually\nor\nrun a PowerShell script\nto create registry values automatically.\nAdd the slack.exe registry value manually\nFrom your computer, press the\nWin\nand\nR\nkeys, then type\nregedit.exe\n.\nCheck for the following keys and add any you don't see:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Citrix/CtxHook\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Wow6432Node/Citrix/CtxHook\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Wow6432Node/Citrix/CtxHook64\nIf it doesn't already exist, ensure to add a registry value to each key listed above:\nName:\nExcludedImageNames\nType:\nREG_SZ\nValue:\nslack.exe\nIf\nExcludedImageNames\nalready exists, make sure\nslack.exe\nis added to the names of executables, and ensure they are comma separated, like so:\nApp1.exe,App2.exe,slack.exe\nCheck for the following key, and add it if it isn't there:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/services/CtxUvi\nIf you added the key from step 5, ensure you also add the following registry value:\nName:\nUviProcessExcludes\nType:\nREG_SZ\nValue:\nslack.exe\nIf\nUviProcessExcludes\nalready exists, make sure to add\nslack.exe\nto the names of executables, separated by a semicolon, like so:\nApp1.exe;App2.exe;slack.exe\nFor additional information,\nsee the official Citrix documentation\n.\nRun a PowerShell script to create registry values\nDownload this PowerShell script\n.\nWhen the download is complete, right-click the script file and select\nRun with PowerShell\n.\nReboot your machine, then re-launch the Slack desktop app.\nTip:\nIf you're unable to run the PowerShell script because of an execution policy violation,\nfollow Microsoft's documentation\nto update your computer's policies.\nAwesome!\nThanks so much for your feedback!\nIf you’d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to\nfeedback@slack.com\n.\nGot it!\nIf you’d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to\nfeedback@slack.com\n.\nIf you’d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to\nfeedback@slack.com\n.\nOops!

status sync integrations can prevent Reclaim from setting your Slack status.\nUpdated over 2 years ago\nTable of contents\nIf you've set a custom status for certain events in Slack through your Reclaim Slack app settings, but still can't see them, you may be facing one of these issues:\nYour existing Slack status settings may be preventing Reclaim status updates.\nIf you're using the Google Calendar integration for Slack, or another integration that sets your status automatically, it may be overriding Reclaim's status sync.\nTroubleshooting steps\nGo to your\nReclaim\napp in Slack.\nClick on the\nHome\ntab at the top, then click\nSettings\n.\nCheck to make sure you have Status Sync turned\nOn\n.\nIf you have enabled the Google Calendar integration for Slack, disable the integration's Slack status feature (you can see if it's enabled by typing\n/gcal settings\n).\nCheck to make sure you don't have any other apps enabled that are setting your Slack status.\nTurn the Reclaim status sync feature off and then on again in settings (\n/reclaim settings\n) to force Reclaim to reset your Slack status:\nIf you're still having issues, contact us at\n[email protected]\nand

There was also an extra slacky octothorpe in the notifications bar. Right-click-quit was sufficient.\nEric\n–\nEric\n2015-06-29 22:56:49 +00:00\nCommented\nJun 29, 2015 at 22:56\n1\nDefinitely didn't help me. There are 5 instances of slack.exe running, whenever you start the app, but they all get stopped when I quit the app. When I start it again - reconnecting still hangs. I also tried going to the browser and explicitly logging out there, starting the app as an admin, turning off the firewall - no help yet. So, the 57MB chat app was deinstalled.\nuserfuser\n–\nuserfuser\n2015-10-27 08:17:32 +00:00\nCommented\nOct 27, 2015 at 8:17\nOk, I had to try to install it again - the same problem persisted. But then I went around and start clicking on buttons that are there, on search field etc and then Slack app threw me a 500 error like \"You've found a Glitch!\" and a pic of a nice forest with piggies and then I was able to go to my wanted board. So, 57MB (zipped!) chat monster remains installed for some more time.\nuserfuser\n–\nuserfuser\n2015-10-27 08:27:08 +00:00\nCommented\nOct 27, 2015 at 8:27\nAnyone running into a situation where the app won't open at all? That's what I'm seeing and so, killing slack.exe won't work.

For me, it was the firewall shield.  I enabled Slack in that shield and all is well again.\nShare\nImprove this answer\nFollow\nanswered\nOct 15, 2020 at 13:41\nCasey\n101\n2\n2 bronze badges\nAdd a comment\n|\nYou must\nlog in\nto answer this question.\nStart asking to get answers\nFind the answer to your question by asking.\nAsk question\nExplore related questions\nwindows\nSee similar questions with these tags.\nThe Overflow Blog\nHow everyone and anyone can use AI for good\nEven your voice is a data problem\nFeatured on Meta\nResults of the January 2026 Community Asks Sprint: Community Badges\nAll users on Stack Exchange can now participate in chat\nRelated\n3\nWhy have all .exe files been changed to .ink, except for Opera?\n1\nBoot.ini tab missing from msconfig in Windows XP\n5\nHow can I fix ugly non-ClearType rendering of webfonts in Firefox without disabling them?\n2\nWin7 keeps warning me about \"slow performance\" and disables Aero & UI effects.

A company that relies heavily on the tool can find itself in trouble when Slack is not working efficiently.\nWe will look at the most common Slack problems you are likely to encounter and offer solutions that should quickly get you up and running again.\nTable of Contents\nConnectivity Issues\nNotifications Not Working\nFile Upload or Download Failures\nScreen Sharing Not Working\nIncorrect Search Results\nUser Management Issues\nSlack Not Working on Windows\nThe Slack Microphone Is Not Working\nSlack Security Issues\nConclusion\nFAQ\nConnectivity Issues\nSome of the most common issues with Slack involve connectivity problems that can result in Slack running slow or, in some cases, not loading at all.\nYou may also run into a situation where Slack keeps reconnecting after losing its connection. The types of connectivity issues you might experience include:\n• Connectivity failures where Slack cannot connect;\n• Loading problems where the app does not load;\n• Server errors affecting the Slack platform;\n• Browser or WebSocket problems that will display an error message.\nLet’s look at how you can try to resolve these problems when they occur.\nSolution 1: Check Internet Connection\nThe first thing to do if Slack cannot connect to your colleagues is to check your Internet connection.\nThe easiest way to verify your Internet connection is to simply try to access another website with your browser. If you can connect to this other site, the Slack platform may be having a problem.\nIf you can’t connect to another site, reset your connection. You may have to reboot your machine to completely restore network connectivity.\nYou can also check the connection using Slack’s connection test which is available at\nslack.com/help/test.\nIf Slack is experiencing a platform-wide outage, you will still be unable to connect to the service. You can check Slack’s status page to see if there is an extensive platform outage.\nSolution 2: Check the Status Page\nIf you still cannot connect to Slack after verifying your Internet connection, you can use the app’s\nstatus board\nto check the Slack system status. The status board is essentially a Slack issue tracker that will inform you of any problems with the site. This page will let you know if Slack is down right now or if it is up and running.\nIn addition to letting you know the up or down Slack status, the page offers information about Slack services such as messaging, files, and notifications. Using the status page is a simple way to see if Slack is having platform-wide problems.\nSolution 3: Clear Cache\nThe Slack cache is used to store recently sent messages so they can be loaded more quickly in the future. The cache can get filled up if you have images or links attached to your messages. This can result in slow response or inconsistent connectivity, making it difficult to communicate effectively.\nIt’s a good idea to clear the Slack cache if you are having issues with connectivity or application speed.\nFollowing are instructions on how to clear the Slack cache on various types of devices.\nClearing the Slack cache on a Mac or a PC\nOpen Slack and click\nHelp\nin the toolbar at the top of the screen.\nHover the mouse over\nTroubleshooting.\nSelect\nClear Cache and Restart.\nClearing Slack cache on iOS device\nOpen the\nSettings\napp.\nScroll down and tap\nSlack\n.\nToggle the\nReset Cache on Next Launch\nswitch.\nClearing Slack cache on Android device\nOpen the Android device’s\nSettings\napp.\nTap the\nApps\noption.\nSelect\nAll apps\nand scroll down to\nSlack\n.\nTap\nStorage & Cache\nand then tap\nClear cache\n.\nNote: If you access Slack through your browser rather than the app, you need to clear your browser’s cache to clear the Slack cache.\nRELATED ARTICLES\n↗\nHow to use multiple accounts and workspaces in Slack\n↗\nHow to organize communication amongst remote support teams\nNotifications Not Working\nNotifications are an important feature of the Slack application. They keep you informed with updates to chats and make sure you respond to colleagues’ queries promptly.\nYour work reputation can be damaged by missing notifications and not responding appropriately. The following solutions show you how to turn on Slack notifications so you don’t miss a thing.\nSolution 1: Allow Notifications in Settings\nSystem settings can be the cause of Slack desktop notifications not working correctly. Depending on the operating system you are using, there are different steps you can take to verify the settings and correct them if necessary.\nFollowing are suggestions for resolving the problem of Slack notifications not working on Windows and Mac machines. We’ll also look at enabling notifications on mobile devices.\nWindows computers\nSeveral settings can cause the problems of Slack notifications not working on Windows 10.\nCheck system settings using the following procedure.\nClick the\nStart menu > Settings > System.\nSelect\nNotifications & Actions\nfrom the left sidebar.\nMake sure that the setting to\nGet notifications from apps and other senders\nis enabled.\nVerify that notifications are enabled for Slack.\nYou should also check your computer’s Focus Assist settings if Slack notifications are not working on Windows 10.\nClick the\nStart menu > Settings > System\n.\nSelect\nFocus Assist\nfrom the left sidebar.\nDisable Focus Assist by selecting\nOff\nto resume Slack notifications.\nmacOS computers\nIf Slack notifications are not working on your Mac, you can try the following solutions.\nOpen\nSystem Preferences\nand click on\nNotifications.\nSelect Slack from the list.\nEnsure the alert style is set to\nBanners\nor\nAlerts\n.\nCheck the Do Not Disturb settings which may be leading to Mac Slack notifications not working.\nClick the toggle icon at the top right of your screen to open the Mac Notification Center.\nClick\nDo Not Disturb\nand ensure that it is toggled off.\nMobile devices\nThe simplest way to enable notifications may be to force quit the app and restart your device. If that doesn’t work, you can run a test from the Slack app using the following steps.\nTap\nYou\nat the bottom of your screen.\nTap\nNotifications.\nTap\nTroubleshoot Notifications\n.\nIf you don’t get any useful information from the test, you may have to try reinstalling the Slack app to regain the ability to receive notifications.\nSolution 2: Enable Paused Notifications\nYou may have stopped receiving Slack because you have paused them in the app to stop a flood of notifications that you didn’t want to see and forgot to turn them back on. It’s easy to turn notifications back on with a few steps.\nWhen using Slack on a desktop, use the following procedure.\nClick the account and move the mouse over\nPause notifications\n.\nYou will see a\nDo Not Disturb\npopup if notifications are paused.\nClick\nResume notifications\nto resolve the issue.\nIf using the app on a mobile device, use the following steps.\nTap\nYou\nat the bottom right of the Slack screen.\nTap\nPause notifications\n.\nTap\nResume notifications\n.\nSolution 3: Enable Sound\nThe sounds that accompany notifications are an important aspect of the feature. Users can be advised of the receipt of a notification without looking at their device if the sound is working correctly. If Slack is not making notification sounds, you need to ensure they are enabled by your operating system.\nWindows OS\nClick the\nStart menu > Settings > System\n.\nSelect\nNotifications & Actions\n.\nLocate Slack in the list and ensure that\nPlay a sound\nis enabled.\nmacOS\nOpen\nSystem Preferences > Notifications\n.\nFind Slack in the list and verify that\nPlay sound for notifications\nis enabled.\nSelect\nSound\nand click\nSound effects\n.\nMake sure the correct device is selected next to\nPlay sound effects through\nand that the alert volume is turned up.\nEnsure the box is checked next to\nPlay user interface sound effects\n.\nSolution 4: Unmute сHannel or DM\nThe last solution we will discuss to resolve the Slack notification not working problem is to ensure that you have not muted the channel of DM that is sending notifications. Use the following procedure to check the mute settings and restore sound notifications from Slack.\nOpen the Slack channel and go to\nchannel details\n.\nMake sure the Mute channel toggle at the bottom of the screen is disabled. If it is enabled, disable it.\nRepeat the above steps for all channels that are not providing sound with notifications.\nFile Upload or Download Failures\nUsers can typically upload files to a Slack workspace where they can be viewed by others or downloaded to their devices. If file uploads and downloads are not working correctly it can impact productivity and slow down team progress.\nThe following are several possible solutions to resolve this issue.\nSolution 1: Upload Fewer Files\nThe problem may be that you are attempting to upload too much information at one time. Slack enforces a max file size of 1GB, so any files larger than that will have to be transferred using an alternate method.\nYou might also have exceeded the Slack file upload limit. Slack won’t let you upload more than 10 files at a time. Try sending fewer files and see if that resolves the problem.\nSolution 2: Update or Reinstall the App\nIf you use the Slack app, it’s always a good move to check for updates if the tool is not working correctly. There might be a fix for the problem in a newer version of Slack.\nSolution 3: Create a New File and Disable Security Tools\nAnother option to try is to recreate the file, perhaps in a different format, and retry the file transfer. If that doesn’t work, you may have an issue with your security tools.\nYour device’s security solutions may be prohibiting you from uploading or downloading the files you need.\nTry disabling antivirus and firewall software\nand retry the operation. Make sure to enable the security tool when you are finished transferring your files.\nSolution 4: Clear the Cache\nWhen using Slack through a web browser, file transfers can be impacted by a problem with the browser’s cache. Clear the cache using the appropriate procedure for your browser.\nScreen Sharing Not Working\nScreen sharing can be very important when Slack is used as a collaborative tool.\nTeam productivity is negatively affected when\nSlack screen sharing\nis not working.\nFollowing are several steps you can take to try and resolve or get around the screen sharing problem.\nSolution 1: Disable Background Apps\nWindows users can try disabling background apps that may be inhibiting screen sharing with the following procedure.\nOpen\nTask Manager\nwith the\nCtrl-Shift-Esc\nkeystroke combination.\nSelect the app you want to end from the\nProcesses\ntab.\nClick on\nEnd task\n.\nSolution 2: Update Slack and OS\nUpdating Slack and your operating system to the latest level is always a good idea. Check for updates for your OS and apply them. In the Slack\nHelp\nmenu, you can click on\nCheck for Updates\nto see if there are any available. Updates will automatically be downloaded to your computer.\nSolution 3: Enable Screen Recording on Mac\nIf you are running macOS, you may need to turn on screen recording to fix the issue with the following steps.\nOpen\nSystem Preferences\n.\nSelect\nSecurity & Privacy\n.\nSwitch to the\nPrivacy\ntab.\nSelect\nScreen Recording\nfrom the menu.\nUnlock\nScreen Recording\nwith your system password.\nIncorrect Search Results\nYou may need to locate a specific Slack message and not have the time or desire to scroll through all of your channels. Fortunately, Slack has a search facility that you can use to efficiently find the messages you need. But sometimes, the results of your search query may not be what you are looking for, and Slack will be loading messages that you don’t want to see.\nSometimes Slack continues to display unread messages that won’t go away. If you run into this problem, clearing the Slack cache should resolve the issue.\nIf Slack is returning inaccurate or incomplete results, try the following options to improve Slack’s search performance.\nSolution 1: Writing Ideal Search Query\nYou need to know how to search in Slack if you want to get accurate results. Creating a valid query that encompasses the information you want is necessary for efficient searching. If you are not getting enough results, try a more general query. Alternatively, if you are getting too much information returned from your query, try a more specific query concentrating on keywords in the message.\nSolution 2: Messages, Files, Channels, and People: Four Search Categories\nSlack provides four search categories. Based on the search category, the words in your query will return different types of results as illustrated below.\n• Messages – Words in your query will appear somewhere in the returned messages.\n• Files – The query text may be part of a file name or be included in the body of the file.\n• Channels – Queries targeting channels return channel names, descriptions, and topics.\n• People – Searching people looks for matching names and information contained in a user’s profile.\nSolution 3: Narrow Search With Filters\nWhen creating a query, you can use filters to narrow the search so it returns better results. There are multiple filters available, located under the primary search categories, that allow you to look for specific file types or messages sent before a particular date, among other options. Filters can greatly reduce the number of results returned from a search and improve productivity.\nSolution 4: Narrow Search With Modifiers\nYou can also add modifiers to your searches to help return better results. While some are similar to the available filters, additional modifiers let you look for specific messages based on factors such as who they were sent to or if they had a particular emoji reaction.\nUser Management Issues\nAdministrators and workspace owners are responsible for Slack account management. Care must be taken to set permissions correctly when adding new members to a workspace. Let’s look at which permissions can be set by a Slack administrator.\nSolution: Set Permissions\nAdmins can set the following permissions to control how users interact with Slack.\n• Restricting users to only installing apps from the Slack App Directory that have been reviewed and approved by Slack;\n• Allowing multi-channel guests to use shortcuts;\n• Only allow rich link previews from apps that are installed in the workspace.\nSlack Not Working on Windows\nIf you are having issues with the Slack Windows app, multiple solutions may fix the problem. You may not be able to get the full functionality of the app or in some cases, Slack won’t open on your Windows computer. This can make it impossible for you to communicate with coworkers until the issues are addressed.\nTry one of the following procedures to resolve the problem if Slack is not working on your Windows machine.\nSolution 1: Close Unnecessary Apps on the Computer\nYou may have too many apps running on your machine when you try to launch Slack. Close any apps that are not needed at this time and try restarting Slack.\nSolution 2: Temporarily Disable Antivirus Software\nIn some cases, your antivirus software may be impacting your ability to run Slack. You can try temporarily disabling antivirus programs and restarting Slack.

If any are available, apply them to Slack and then restart the application.\nUse Alternative to Slack\nIf none of the solutions discussed works to resolve the audio issue, you may need to use a different tool to communicate with your colleagues. Many alternatives to Slack are available including Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Skype. You may need to move to another platform until you can resolve your Slack microphone problem.\nRELATED ARTICLES\n↗\nHow to give or request remote control on Zoom\n↗\nHow to screen share on MS teams\n↗\nHow to use remote control in GoToMeeting\n↗\nHow to give or request remote control on Webex\nSlack Security Issues\nSecurity is a top priority in all areas of computing and IT. Slack security concerns may cause some people to be reluctant about using the app. Users may be wondering how secure Slack is and if it’s safe to use for business communication.\nSeveral Slack security issues need to be addressed to protect your communication and the privacy of any data you share. Some issues with how secure Slack is are related to the app’s code, but others can be mitigated by eliminating users error and following best practices. Following are security and Slack privacy concerns that users need to keep in mind when using the app.\n•\nOnboarding and off-boarding new employees and guest users\n– Users who are terminated or leave a company need to have their Slack account deleted immediately.Guest users who are given access to Slack need to be removed as soon as possible after their work is finished. Failure to remove accounts may leave important information available to unauthorized users.\n•\nPowerful Owner and Admin roles\n– Slack Owners and Admins have to understand the power of those roles. Individuals who are assigned those roles need to use that power wisely to avoid potential risks and data loss from inadvertently deleting user groups. Companies should try to restrict the number of users given these roles and ensure that the appropriate employees are trusted with their power.\n•\nThird-party application integrations\n– Connecting Slack to a third-party app can lead to potential vulnerabilities. Companies should make sure that the correct authentication protocols are in place and being used to protect data. This is especially true if you are connecting to apps that have access to sensitive or valuable data resources.\n•\nExternal threat actors\n– Because of its popularity, Slack is a prime target for hackers. They may try to identify an undiscovered Slack vulnerability that can be exploited. Stolen or compromised credentials enable unauthorized users to access enterprise data. Users must be aware of the risks and keep their credentials secure.\n•\nInternal risks\n– There is some concern with the access to an organization’s data by Slack employees. This fact highlights the importance of being careful with how you share sensitive information.\nOrganizations deploying Slack can take the following steps to increase the app’s security.\nSolution 1: Turn on Two-Factor Authentication\nEnable two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users. Slack provides instructions on how to integrate 2FA with a single sign-on solution. This helps guard against unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.\nSolution 2: Apply Your Company’s Email Security Policies to Slack\nUse your company’s email security policy as a guide for protecting Slack. It should include a caution against sharing passwords, sending sensitive information through the app, and enforcing strong passwords.\nSolution 3: Slack Security Training\nSlack security training should be mandatory for all users. Training should reinforce email security policy to include awareness of the type of information that can safely be communicated through the app. It should also stress the importance of using strong passwords and protecting credentials by not sharing them.\nRELATED ARTICLES\n↗\nSecurity issues in Microsoft Teams\nConclusion\nSlack is a valuable tool used by many businesses to streamline collaboration and team communication.

I've been noticing a lot of odd behavior over the last few months (at least) and I'm trying to figure out how to troubleshoot it.\nThe system has 32 GB of ram, AMD Ryzen 5900X CPU, MSI MAG B550 Tomahawk MD, and a couple SSDs attached.\nThe symptoms are:\nBrowser tabs crash all the time. Every 15 minutes or so, one of my open tabs (of which I typically have ~20-30) will crash (with \"Aw Snap!\" in Chrome, and similar messages in Firefox and Chromium).\nSlack will crash intermittently. About 1-2 times per day it just hangs for about a minute and then dies.\nMy virtual machines will corrupt. I typically have 1-3 open at a time, and about once a month, my VM will start complaining about having a read only file system. I'll reboot and it boots into initramfs, and running fsck across the disk typically fixes it.\nMy gut is that I could have some failing RAM, but I don't know how to troubleshoot that. Are there logs I could look at that would help figure out why Chrome is crashing all the time?\nThanks in advance!\nEdited to add at @heynnema request:\ndavid@jawad:~$ ls -lah /var/crash/\ntotal 240M\ndrwxrwsrwt  2 root     whoopsie 4.0K Mar 22 10:43 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 15 root     root     4.0K Aug 31  2021 ..\n-rw-r-----  1 david     whoopsie  35M Mar 22 01:13 _opt_google_chrome_chrome.1000.crash\n-rw-r-----  1 david     whoopsie  27M Mar 22 10:43 _usr_bin_python3.8.1000.crash\n-rw-r-----  1 david     whoopsie  60M Mar 15 15:51 _usr_lib_insync_PySide2_Qt_libexec_QtWebEngineProcess.1000.crash\n-rw-r--r--  1 david     whoopsie    0 Mar 15 15:51 _usr_lib_insync_PySide2_Qt_libexec_QtWebEngineProcess.1000.upload\n-rw-------  1 whoopsie whoopsie   37 Mar 15 15:51 _usr_lib_insync_PySide2_Qt_libexec_QtWebEngineProcess.1000.uploaded\n-rw-r-----  1 david     whoopsie  98M Mar 22 07:28 _usr_lib_slack_slack.1000.crash\n-rw-r-----  1 david     whoopsie  22M Mar 17 09:45 _usr_share_typora_Typora.1000.crash\nWill get memtest as well.\nNext edit as reuqested:\n# lshw -C memory\n  *-firmware                \n       description: BIOS\n       vendor: American Megatrends International, LLC.\n       physical id: 0\n       version: A.60\n       date: 05/12/2021\n       size: 64KiB\n       capacity: 32MiB\n       capabilities: pci upgrade shadowing cdboot bootselect socketedrom edd int13floppynec int13floppytoshiba int13floppy360 int13floppy1200 int13floppy720 int13floppy2880 int5printscreen int9keyboard int14serial int17printer int10video acpi usb biosbootspecification uefi\n  *-memory\n       description: System Memory\n       physical id: 10\n       slot: System board or motherboard\n       size: 32GiB\n     *-bank:0\n          description: 2667 MHz (0.4 ns) [empty]\n          product: Unknown\n          vendor: Unknown\n          physical id: 0\n          serial: Unknown\n          slot: DIMM 0\n          clock: 2667MHz (0.4ns)\n     *-bank:1\n          description: DIMM DDR4 Synchronous Unbuffered (Unregistered) 2667 MHz (0.4 ns)\n          product: F4-3200C16-16GVK\n          vendor: Unknown\n          physical id: 1\n          serial: 00000000\n          slot: DIMM 1\n          size: 16GiB\n          width: 64 bits\n          clock: 2667MHz (0.4ns)\n     *-bank:2\n          description: 2667 MHz (0.4 ns) [empty]\n          product: Unknown\n          vendor: Unknown\n          physical id: 2\n          serial: Unknown\n          slot: DIMM 0\n          clock: 2667MHz (0.4ns)\n     *-bank:3\n          description: DIMM DDR4 Synchronous Unbuffered (Unregistered) 2667 MHz (0.4 ns)\n          product: F4-3200C16-16GVK\n          vendor: Unknown\n          physical id: 3\n          serial: 00000000\n          slot: DIMM 1\n          size: 16GiB\n          width: 64 bits\n          clock: 2667MHz (0.4ns)\n  *-cache:0\n       description: L1 cache\n       physical id: 13\n       slot: L1 - Cache\n       size: 768KiB\n       capacity: 768KiB\n       clock: 1GHz (1.0ns)\n       capabilities: pipeline-burst internal write-back unified\n       configuration: level=1\n  *-cache:1\n       description: L2 cache\n       physical id: 14\n       slot: L2 - Cache\n       size: 6MiB\n       capacity: 6MiB\n       clock: 1GHz (1.0ns)\n       capabilities: pipeline-burst internal write-back unified\n       configuration: level=2\n  *-cache:2\n       description: L3 cache\n       physical id: 15\n       slot: L3 - Cache\n       size: 64MiB\n       capacity: 64MiB\n       clock: 1GHz (1.0ns)\n       capabilities: pipeline-burst internal write-back unified\n       configuration: level=3\nram\ncrash\nShare\nImprove this question\nFollow\nedited\nMar 23, 2022 at 15:53\nasked\nMar 22, 2022 at 15:39\nDCHeel\n33\n6\n6 bronze badges\n5\nEdit your question and show me\nls -al /var/crash\n.

This may take a few hours to complete.\nUpdate #1:\nmemtest\nfailed. Show me\nsudo lshw -C memory\n.\nUpdate #2:\nYou have two 16G DIMMs of memory. First, power off the computer, and remove, then reinsert each DIMM, and re-run\nmemtest\n. If it passes, then you've probably fixed the problem.\nIf it fails, remove one 16G DIMM and re-run\nmemtest\n. If it fails, that DIMM\nmay\nbe defective.\nIn either case, remove that DIMM and reinsert the other DIMM and re-run\nmemtest\n.\nIt's important to write down which DIMM passed, and which DIMM failed. Report back.\nUpdate #3:\nmemtest\nfails on individual DIMMs. Suspect RAM compatibility issue, but first we need to update the BIOS and retest with\nmemtest\n. Get the BIOS update\nhere\n.\nNote\n: Confirm that I have the correct web page for your motherboard (MSI MAG B550 Tomahawk MD).\nNote\n: Have good backups before updating the BIOS.\nUpdate #4:\nYour memory DIMMs (F4-3200C16-16GVK) don't appear on the memory compatibility lists shown\nhere\n.\nUpdate #5:\nReview pages 13 and 15 of the User Manual\nhere\nand confirm that DIMM slot A2 is filled first, and B2 next, with exact same spec DIMMs.\nUpdate #6:\nSee\nhttps://www.crucial.com/\nfor correct spec DIMMs. See\nhttps://www.crucial.com/compatible-upgrade-for/msi-%28micro-star%29/mag-b550-tomahawk\nUpdate #7:\nConfirm that CPU and RAM are NOT overclocked.

Or is it important to run the full test?  I get the same result with both removed and reset and with each individually - within the first minute, 50+ errors, and then hundreds of errors within a few minutes. I can run the full test later when I don't need my computer if that's necessary.\nDCHeel\n–\nDCHeel\n2022-03-23 21:18:58 +00:00\nCommented\nMar 23, 2022 at 21:18\n@DCHeel No, if you're getting errors with only one stick installed at a time, you don't need to run it further. You have a RAM compatibility problem. First thing is to update the BIOS and retest with\nmemtest\n. Go to\nus.msi.com/Motherboard/MAG-B550-TOMAHAWK/support\nto get the update. If\nmemtest\nstill fails, then we need to check RAM compatibility.

When it detects that memory pressure is getting a bit too stressed, it intervenes to ensure the system copes, and (most) things stay running. I hope it helps you.\nMost\nsystemd\nservices can be managed via the\nsystemctl\nutility. In this case, we want to disable the\nsystemd-oomd\nservice. This can be done with:\n$ systemctl disable --now systemd-oomd\nYou should see something like (depending on your OS):\n$ systemctl disable --now systemd-oomd\nRemoved /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/systemd-oomd.service.\nRemoved /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.oom1.service.\nYou can then verify that the service is disabled, with:\n$ systemctl is-enabled systemd-oomd\nAnd you should then see:\n$ systemctl is-enabled systemd-oomd\ndisabled\nIt is possible, however, that other services might attempt to restart the\nsystemd-oomd\nservice. To prevent this, you can 'mask' the service. For example:\n$ systemctl mask systemd-oomd\nCreated symlink /etc/systemd/system/systemd-oomd.service → /dev/null.\nAnd then\nsystemctl is-enabled\nshould now report:\n$ systemctl is-enabled systemd-oomd\nmasked\nSee\nman systemctl\nfor more details; in particular, note the caveats regarding masking of\nsystemd\nservices.\nHow do I disable the systemd OOM process killer in Ubuntu 22.04?\nShare\nImprove this answer\nFollow\nedited\nJun 23, 2022 at 13:40\nanswered\nJun 21, 2022 at 18:11\nJuan Torchia\n151\n4\n4 bronze badges\n2\n1\nWhile this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.

content\nSlack templates\nEngineering templates\nIssue Log Template\nGet Template\nTags:\nEngineering\nIT\nFile management\nShare this template\nAbout this template\nYour team’s ability to manage and resolve issues can make or break your project’s success. Without a centralized system, teams can quickly lose visibility into open issues. Our issue log template allows project managers, QA engineers, and product teams to log, track, and resolve issues in one central hub. This template helps prevent unresolved issues from becoming roadblocks, keeping your team focused on the big picture.\nWhy is an issue log template important?\nAn issue log template serves as your single source of truth for tracking and managing problems throughout your project’s lifecycle. This systematic approach to issue documentation helps project managers and team members identify bottlenecks, allocate resources effectively, and maintain clear accountability for issue resolution. With a standardized issue list template, teams can quickly capture essential details about each obstacle, track its progress, and follow through until resolution.\nThe benefits of our issue tracking template solution\nSwift issue resolution is key to maintaining project momentum and delivering successful outcomes, and you can’t resolve what you don’t track. Our issue tracking template solution combines powerful automation with intuitive workflows to help teams identify, document, and resolve problems efficiently. By centralizing issue management in Slack — where your team already collaborates — you can reduce response times, improve visibility, and empower consistent follow-through on every reported issue.\nHere’s how our open issues list template transforms the way your team handles issues:\nCentralized issue management\nOur issue log template is your centralized solution for managing internal and external project issues efficiently. This template allows the project manager and team members to document, track, and escalate issues to be resolved systematically, ensuring that problems are addressed promptly and effectively. By consolidating all issue-related communication in one place, this template not only enhances team coordination but also improves the overall project planning and execution process.\nStreamlined issue reporting\nThis template makes it easy for team members to log issues as they arise. Each issue can be documented with a detailed description, target date, and priority level, ensuring that project managers have all the information needed to plan resolutions. This streamlined reporting process encourages team members to report problems promptly, which helps keep track of project progress and prevents delays.\nAutomated issue tracking\nOur issue log template includes an automated issue tracker template, where new issues are added as soon as they’re reported. This tracker template serves as a live inventory of current project issues, allowing the project team to view progress, assign resources, and resolve issues efficiently. Features such as automated status updates and impact analysis are an easy way to manage issues that arise during a project’s life cycle. Additionally, this resource management tool helps ensure no issue is overlooked.\nGuided issue submission\nTo assist team members in reporting issues accurately, the template features a how-to-submit-an-issue canvas. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on what to include when reporting an issue, such as the description, impact, and steps to reproduce. By standardizing issue reporting, the template improves the quality of submissions, making it easier to resolve the issue and keep people and projects on track. This feature is particularly useful for project teams that need to track multiple issues across various stages of the project plan.\nEnhanced project management\nIncorporating issue tracking template management into your workflow makes it easy to integrate with other project management templates and tools, such as work management systems. This integration ensures a seamless flow of information across the team, enabling effective planning and resource allocation. Whether you’re dealing with project issues, resource management, or tracking the project’s lifecycle, this free issue tracking tool provides a reliable and organized solution.\nUse this template to enhance your team’s ability to track issues, document resolutions, and maintain project momentum. Designed with project managers, product managers, developers, and other team members in mind, this template simplifies complex workflows, enabling you to focus on what matters most: delivering successful projects.\nWhat should you include in an issue management template?\nAn effective issue management template should capture all the information necessary to track and ultimately resolve issues. Our template is structured to include the following key fields needed for efficient issue tracking:\nIssue name:\nIdentify the issue, making it easy for team members to reference and search for specific problems.\nStatuses:\nUse predefined stages such as “New,” “Triaged,” “In Progress,” “Blocked,” “Done,” and “Backlog” to track the current status of each issue, making it easy to monitor progress visually in a Kanban view.\nSeverity:\nCategorize issues as “High,” “Medium,” or “Low” priority to help teams focus on resolving the most critical problems first.\nDetails:\nA text field where team members can provide a detailed description of the issue, including reproduction steps, expected behavior, and any relevant screenshots or supporting documentation.\nSubmitted by:\nAutomatically logs the name of the team member who reported the issue, providing context for follow-ups if more information is needed.\nDate submitted:\nTimestamp records the date the issue was reported, helping project managers track issue timelines and prioritize tasks accordingly.\nAssignee:\nAssigns responsibility for resolving the issue to a specific team member, designating clear ownership and accountability for each task.\nOur streamlined issue tracking template captures just the right level of detail without creating unnecessary complexity. By using this template, project managers can effectively prioritize, track, and resolve issues with full accountability and visibility throughout the process.\nIssue list template best practices\nUsing an issue list template involves more than just filling out a form and calling it a day. Here are some best practices for optimal issue management:\nSet priorities early:\nAssign priority levels based on the potential impact on your project. High-priority issues should take precedence to avoid bottlenecks.\nUse clear naming conventions:\nStandardize issue names to make it easy for team members to search and identify related issues quickly.\nProvide sufficient context:\nDetailed descriptions with relevant screenshots and reproduction steps reduce confusion and accelerate problem solving.\nEstablish clear ownership:\nFor each issue, assign a dedicated owner who will be responsible for providing updates and driving resolution.\nAutomate updates:\nUse Slack workflows or third-party integrations to automate reminders and status updates to keep everyone informed.\nReview regularly:\nMaintain a status update schedule to provide consistent visibility into progress and roadblocks.\nDocument resolution steps:\nRecord the steps taken to resolve each issue, creating a valuable knowledge base for similar problems in the future.\nThird-party integrations to complement your open issues template\nImprove your overall project management by integrating your Slack issue tracking system with the tools your team already uses. Here are some examples of powerful third-party integrations to supercharge your issue tracking capabilities:\nGoogle Workspace\nSeamlessly attach relevant documents, spreadsheets, and presentations from\nGoogle Drive\ndirectly to your issue logs. Team members can collaborate on solution documentation in real time, while maintaining version control and keeping all issue-related resources organized in one place.\nZoom\nInstantly escalate urgent issues by scheduling\nZoom\ncalls through Slack, improving response time for critical problems. Additionally, convert important issue discussions from meetings into actionable items in your issue log.\nAsana\nTransform logged issues into actionable project tasks without switching contexts with\nAsana\n. Create and update tasks directly from Slack, sync status updates automatically, and maintain alignment between issue resolution and broader project timelines.\nHow can an issue log template help in project management?\nAn issue log template provides a systematic way to track and manage problems that arise during a project’s lifecycle. This helps project managers identify patterns, allocate resources efficiently, and prevent similar issues from recurring. An effective issue log template maintains project momentum by reducing bottlenecks and ensuring stakeholder visibility into project timelines.\nHow can an issue log template improve team collaboration?\nIssue log templates create a shared understanding of problems and their statuses across the team. By centralizing all issue-related data and making it accessible to everyone, they facilitate better communication about blockers, establish clear ownership and accountability, and help teams coordinate more effectively towards issue resolution.\nWhat are the key features of Slack’s issue log template?\nSlack’s issue log template includes a Kanban-style status board (New, Triaged, In Progress, Blocked, Done, Backlog), severity level tracking (High, Medium, Low), and automated capture of who submitted each issue with a timestamped submission date. Each issue entry includes fields for the issue name, detailed description, and assignee. This structure provides a consistent and systematic approach to issue documentation, with clear visibility into issue progress.\nCan Slack’s issue log template be customized for different teams?\nYes, Slack’s issue log template can be adapted to meet specific team needs. Teams can modify status categories, adjust severity levels, add custom fields, and tailor the template structure to match their workflow automation.

Vendors often delay acknowledging problems, so user reports help us alert you before the official announcement.\nEngineering and operations teams rely on IsDown to track Slack status and receive verified outage alerts through Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, or 20+ other integrations.\nHow IsDown Monitors Slack\nIsDown checks Slack's status page every few minutes, across all 11 components.\n                    We combine official status data with user reports to detect when Slack is down, often before the vendor announces it.\nWhen Slack status changes, IsDown sends alerts to your preferred channels. Filter by severity to skip noise and focus on outages that affect your business.\nStart Monitoring for Free\nWhat you get when monitoring Slack with IsDown\nTrack Slack incidents and downtimes by severity\nIsDown checks Slack official status page for major/minor outages or downtimes. A major outage is when Slack experiences a critical issue that severely affects one or more services/regions. A minor incident is when Slack experiences a small issue affecting a small percentage of its customer's applications. An example is the performance degradation of an application. The moment we detect a Slack outage, we send you an alert and update your dashboard and status page.\nGet alerted as soon as users report problems with Slack\nSlack and other vendors don't always report outages on time. IsDown collects user reports to provide early detection of outages. This way, even without an official status update, you can stay ahead of possible problems.\nAll the details of Slack outages and downtimes\nIsDown collects all information from the outages published in Slack status page to provide the context of the outage. If available, we gather the title, description, time of the outage, status, and outage updates. Another important piece of information is the affected services/regions which we use to filter the notifications that impact your business.\nOnly get alerted on the Slack outages that impact your business\nIsDown monitors Slack and all their 11 components that can be affected by an outage. IsDown allows you to filter the notifications and status page alerts based on the components you care about. For example, you can choose which components or regions affect your business and filter out all other outages. This way you avoid alert fatigue in your team.\nSimple & Powerful\nHow IsDown Works\nGet started in minutes.

IsDown combines official status page data with user reports to show whether Slack is down for everyone or if the issue is on your end.\nWhat Slack components does IsDown monitor?\nIsDown monitors 11 Slack components in real-time, tracking the official status page for outages, degraded performance, and scheduled maintenance.\nHow to check if Slack is down?\nSubscribe (if possible) to updates on the\nofficial status page\n.\nCreate an account in IsDown\n. Start monitoring Slack and get alerts in real-time when Slack has outages.\nWhy use IsDown to monitor Slack  instead of the official status page?\nBecause IsDown is a status page aggregator, which means that we aggregate the status of multiple cloud services.\n                You can monitor Slack and all the services that impact your business. Get a dashboard with the health of all services and status updates.\n                Set up notifications via\nSlack\n,\nDatadog\n,\nPagerDuty\n, and more, when a service you monitor has issues or when maintenances are scheduled.\nHow IsDown compares to DownDetector when monitoring Slack?\nIsDown and DownDetector help users determine if Slack is having problems. The big difference is that IsDown is a status page aggregator. IsDown monitors a service's official status page to give our customers a more reliable source of information instead of just relying on reports from users. The integration allows us to provide more details about Slack's Outages, like incident title, description, updates, and the parts of the affected service. Additionally, users can create internal status pages and set up notifications for all their third-party services.\nLatest Articles from our Blog\nFeb 11, 2026\nAWS CloudFront Outage (Feb 2026): Timeline, Cascade, and Lessons\nAWS CloudFront DNS failures on Feb 10 cascaded to 20+ services.

Our platform tracks every\nreported outage, performance issue, and maintenance window to ensure\nyou're informed. Whether Slack is experiencing a problem now or\nhas recently resolved one, our detailed history keeps you updated.\nMore than 2,200\nStatusGator users monitor Slack\nto get notified when it's down, is under maintenance,\nor has an outage.\nThis makes it\none of the most popular Chat services\nmonitored on our platform.\nWe've sent more than 599,700 notifications to our users\nabout Slack incidents, providing transparency and peace of mind.\nYou can get alerts by\nsigning up\nfor a free StatusGator account.\nEarly Warning Signals\nIf we detect a potential Slack outage or other issue\nbefore it was reported on the official status page\nwe will send an Early Warning Signal notification to StatusGator subscribers.\nWe can often detect issues before they are officially acknowledged by the\nprovider, giving you a head start on resolving any potential problems.\nDown Notifications\nIf Slack is having system outages or experiencing other\ncritical issues, red\ndown\nnotifications appear on the status page.  In\nmost cases, it means that core functions are not working properly, or\nthere is some other serious customer-impacting event underway.\nWarning Notifications\nWarn\nnotifications are used when Slack is undergoing a\nnon-critical issue like minor service issues, performance degradation,\nnon-core bugs, capacity issues, or problems affecting a small number of\nusers.\nMaintenance Notifications\nSlack posts separate notifications for planned maintenance\nwork. StatusGator will notify subscribers when Slack enters a\npre-planned maintenance window, keeping you up to date.\nStatus Messages\nWhen Slack posts issues on their status page, we collect the\nmain headline message and include that brief information or overview in\nnotifications to StatusGator subscribers.\nStatus Details\nWhen Slack has outages or other service-impacting events on\ntheir status page, we pull down the detailed informational updates and\ninclude them in notifications. These messages often include the current\ndetails about how the problem is being mitigated, or when the next update\nwill occur.\nComponent Status Filtering\nBecause Slack has several components, each with their\nindividual statuses, StatusGator can differentiate the status of each\ncomponent in our notifications to you whenever a particular component is down.

They have a support channel (internal to the org) that has their team name in it and want it to reflect their new name.\nBefore I do this, It'd be great to hear from someone who has done this. I couldn't find an article that gave me 100% clarity or confidence around what will happen.\nMost notably:\n- I am assuming that underlying id/url for the channel is the same so any links integrations etc will not be affected?\n- If a user searches for the old team name will they see the \"new\" channel as an option, if not, is there a way to retain this old association or create an \"alias\"\n- Anything else I need to consider?\nThanks!\nu/attio\n•\nPromoted\nAsk more from your CRM.\nattio.com\nSign Up\nProject Management Tool Comparison Table (2026) for Slack-based teams\nu/jpreddituser1\n•\nProject Management Tool Comparison Table (2026) for Slack-based teams\nHey ya’ll, at the start of the year my team started looking for a new project management solution to track all of our work and act as a single source of truth and I was asked to look at what’s out there and put together a pros/cons list of each so we can make an informed decision. I ended up going pretty deep and felt like it might be useful to other teams.\nOur team lives in Slack (and we don’t want that to change) so I specifically focused on solutions with great Slack integrations. The dream was that we could keep working in Slack, but while having a one-stop-shop outside of Slack where you could see/manage everyone’s work.\nSharing here but let me know if this isn’t the right place for it. Figured this would be a good place since everyone here uses Slack.\nThere are 100s of tools out there so I just focused on the top ones. Let me know if I missed anything important.\nSummary Table\nOverall\nEase of Use\nFeature Depth\nSlack Integration Quality\nTrello\n4.3\n5\n3.5\n4.5\nAsana\n4.2\n4\n5\n3.5\nSlack Lists\n4\n4.5\n2.5\n5\nLinear\n(for dev teams)\n4\n4\n3.5\n4.5\nMonday\n3.8\n4\n4\n3.5\nJira\n(for dev teams)\n3.8\n2.5\n5\n4\nTodoist\n3.7\n5\n2.5\n3.5\nAirtable\n3.7\n3\n5\n3\nBreakdown\nAsana\nEase of Use: 4 / 5\nAsana is easy once your team agrees on a simple “how we use it” pattern (projects, sections, owners, due dates). The friction shows up when people try to use every view/feature at once - you’ll want a lightweight default workflow and templates.\nFeature Depth: 5 / 5\nAsana is built for\nstructured project execution\n, not just tracking tasks: dependencies, milestones, approvals, and multi-homing (same task in multiple projects) are first-class concepts.\nExample: if “Client approval” slips by 3 days, dependency chains make it obvious what downstream work gets pushed, and approvals keep “approved/rejected” explicit instead of buried in comments.\nSlack Integration Quality: 3.5 / 5\nStrong for capture + basic action: you can create tasks from Slack, and use /asana to list/create/complete/comment on tasks from inside Slack.\nBut it still behaves like “Slack is where tasks are born; Asana is where tasks are managed” - people will click through when work gets real.\nMonday.com\nEase of Use: 4 / 5\nTeams often like it immediately because it feels like a visual spreadsheet with statuses. The downside is consistency - if every client board is configured differently, adoption drops because nobody knows where to look.\nFeature Depth: 4 / 5\nMonday can absolutely do PM fundamentals like dependencies and critical path, but some of the more “true PM” features (milestones/critical path in Gantt) are plan-gated, and the system is more board/column-centric than project-logic-centric.\nExample: you\ncan\nrun a launch chain in a Gantt view with dependencies, but keeping that chain clean across lots of client boards usually turns into more setup/maintenance (columns, views, and rules per board) than in a tool that treats dependencies/approvals as core workflow primitives.\nSlack Integration Quality: 3.5 / 5\nThe integration supports “create items from Slack messages” and “send updates to Slack” patterns, which is the minimum viable Slack workflow.\nIn practice, it’s solid for notifications + capture, but not a “run the project in Slack” experience.\nTrello\nEase of Use: 5 / 5\nThis is the easiest tool here to get a team actually using, because it matches how people already think: “to do / doing / review / done.” If adoption is your #1 constraint, Trello is hard to beat.\nFeature Depth: 3.5 / 5\nGreat for lightweight workflows; less great when you need real sequencing, cross-project visibility, or lots of interdependent deliverables. Example: “Launch date is March 15 so creative must be approved by March 8” can be represented, but it’s not naturally enforced the way dependency-first tools handle it (you’ll rely more on conventions, checklists, and discipline).\nSlack Integration Quality: 4.5 / 5\nTrello is very Slack-friendly: create cards from Slack, preview links, and save Slack messages into Trello (including an Inbox flow).\nExample: a client drops feedback in a Slack thread - you can turn that message into a card immediately, then the PM sorts it to the right board/list later.\nTodoist\nEase of Use: 5 / 5\nFast, clean, and extremely low friction. People will actually use it - but mostly for\ntheir own\ntasks.\nFeature Depth: 2.5 / 5\nTodoist is excellent for personal productivity and light coordination, but it’s not a full team PM system (limited portfolio reporting, dependencies, multi-stage approvals, capacity planning). Example: it’s great for “rewrite homepage headline by Thursday,” weak for “manage a 30-asset campaign launch with reviews, handoffs, and client approvals.”\nSlack Integration Quality: 3.5 / 5\nVery good at capture: you can convert Slack messages into Todoist tasks via the message menu, and complete tasks from Slack via /todoist.\nBut it won’t give you a shared “project heartbeat” inside Slack - it’s more “turn Slack into a personal inbox.”\nAirtable\nEase of Use: 3 / 5\nAirtable is easy to\nuse\nonce built, but harder to\ndesign\nwell. Most teams need an owner (ops/PM) to keep the base clean, otherwise it becomes “power-user magic” that nobody else touches.\nFeature Depth: 5 / 5\nThis is the most flexible system here: you can model clients, campaigns, assets, revisions, approvals, and link them together like a database. Example: one campaign record can relate to 40 deliverable records, each with status, owner, due date, and client approval state - that’s Airtable’s superpower.\nSlack Integration Quality: 3 / 5\nThe native Airtable ↔ Slack story is mainly “send updates/notifications into Slack via Airtable automations” plus link previews - not “turn Slack messages into structured records” out of the box.\nExample: “when status changes to ‘Needs client approval,’ post to #client-approvals” is straightforward, but the actual work still lives in Airtable.\nSlack Lists\nEase of Use: 4.5 / 5\nIt’s native to where your team already works, so adoption is naturally higher than any external PM tool. Example: you can turn a message into a list item and keep the context in the same channel/thread instead of asking people to “go update the PM tool.”\nFeature Depth: 2.5 / 5\nLists cover the basics well (task, status, assignee, due date, custom fields, subtasks), but they’re still “lightweight tracking,” not full project management.\nExample: you can track a launch checklist and assign owners, but you won’t get the same depth as Asana/Monday around dependency graphs, portfolio-level management, workload/capacity, advanced reporting, or complex multi-project governance - and you can hit list size limits (e.g., 1,000 items on Pro/Business+; higher on Enterprise) that external tools don’t typically constrain in the same way.\nSlack Integration Quality: 5 / 5\nIt\nis\nSlack, so the integration is perfect and everyone already has access.\nYou can also add automation via Workflow Builder (e.g., remind assignees about upcoming/overdue tasks, or post periodic status digests into a channel), which is exactly what a Slack-first team usually needs.\nMy one complaint is that the tabs of Lists, Canvasses, pinned comments etc. can become a little messy and disorganized.\nDev Tools\nI included these for completeness but really Linear and Jira are meant for developer teams (which isn’t us).\nLinear\nEase of Use: 4.5 / 5\nLinear is opinionated and fast - most teams can be productive quickly because the workflow is largely “pre-decided” (issues + projects + cycles). Example: you can convert a Slack message into an issue in a couple clicks, and it can keep a synced thread so stakeholders stay in Slack while work progresses.\nFeature Depth: 3.5 / 5\nDeep for\nsoftware execution\n(issues, projects/roadmaps, cycle planning), but less of a general “team PM swiss army knife” than Asana/Monday.\nExample: Linear excels at “track bugs + ship features” workflows, but if you want highly customized approval stages per client, elaborate request-intake forms, or heavily tailored reporting for non-technical stakeholders, you’ll feel the limits of its intentionally simpler model.\nSlack Integration Quality: 4.5 / 5\nOne of the best “Slack capture → real tracking” integrations: create issues from Slack messages, keep comment threads synced both ways, and post channel updates (including notifications driven by custom views).\nExample: a client drops a bug report in #client-acme - you create a Linear issue from that message and the Slack thread stays synced as the issue gets updated/closed, so your account team doesn’t need a Linear account just to stay in the loop.\nJira\nEase of Use: 2.5 / 5\nJira is powerful but heavy - it’s easy for creative/ops teams to bounce off because there are many concepts (issue/work types, workflows, fields) and the UI assumes process maturity.\nExample: two teams can have totally different “Done” definitions because workflows are configurable - great for control, bad for adoption if your team just needs “track work without ceremony.”\nFeature Depth: 5 / 5\nIf you need enterprise-grade process control, Jira is top tier: configurable workflows, rich work categorization, and hierarchy (work items → epics → broader planning), plus advanced planning/roadmapping for multi-team programs.\nExample: you can enforce that “Client Approval” cannot move to “Scheduled” unless required fields are filled and an approval step happened - Jira can make that policy unskippable, whereas lighter tools rely more on human discipline.\nSlack Integration Quality: 4 / 5\nJira’s Slack app is legitimately capable: notifications, link previews, and the ability to interact with work items from Slack (assign, transition, comment) and create work items from Slack messages/threads.\nExample: you can keep a channel subscribed to updates for a Jira project and let teammates transition an issue (e.g., “In Progress” → “In Review”) directly from Slack without opening Jira.\nThe catch is adoption: even with strong Slack controls, Jira only works if your team buys into Jira-style process and hygiene.\nTwo Weeks in as IT Manager – Managing 50 People on Slack\nu/Curious_Aerie_9195\n•\nTwo Weeks in as IT Manager – Managing 50 People on Slack\nI just started as IT manager at a new company, managing a team of about 50. Slack is our main tool for communication, and honestly, I’m already noticing how easy it is for important decisions to get buried in threads or forgotten altogether.\nThere’s no official process yet for tracking decisions, and I’m trying to figure out the best way to avoid duplicate work, confusion, and lost context without overcomplicating things for the team.\nFor those of you managing larger teams on Slack:\nWhat’s the last time a decision got lost in Slack, and what happened as a result?\nHow do you prevent that from happening in your team?\nAny other tips or lessons learned about keeping decisions visible and actionable would be really appreciated.\nReddit Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nUser Agreement\nYour Privacy Choices\nAccessibility\nReddit, Inc. © 2026.

tips\nManage Slack connection issues\nManage Slack connection issues\nThis article is for IT or network administrators in charge of managing an organization’s network. If you ever need a hand with troubleshooting connection issues,\nwe're here to help\n.\nIf you’re not a network admin, check out our guide for troubleshooting Slack’s\nmost common connection issues\n.\nDesktop app\nOlder versions of the Slack desktop app can result in connection issues and even broken features.\nBe sure the desktop app is up-to-date.\nIf you have Slack deployed on multiple Windows machines across your org, you can have the\napp automatically update via MSI installer\n.\nReview the\nsystem requirements\nto run the desktop app.\nNetwork settings\nSlack must have a persistent connection between our messaging server and members’ apps or browsers. To do so, Slack uses WebSockets over port 443.\nProxies and firewalls can sometimes interrupt this connection. If someone using Slack can’t connect from a specific location, or if there’s a WebSocket failure in our\nSlack connection test\n, you’ll need to adjust your proxy or firewall to keep the connection to Slack open. Here’s how:\nVisit\nhttps://my.slack.com/help/urls\nand add all specified URLs to your allowlist. If your environment requires access to multiple workspaces and/or orgs, visit that page from each workspace and/or org.\nCheck if your proxy is running SSL decryption. If it is, the proxy must either support WebSockets, or you’ll need to exempt the following domains: wss-primary.slack.com wss-backup.slack.com wss-mobile.slack.com\nNetwork administrators can restrict access to specific Slack workspaces using\nproxy header injection\non their network. The header injection solution has the same network requirements as above.\nNetwork environment\nCertain software, security settings, and firewalls can interfere with Slack connections:\nSoftware\nAvira Browser Safety\nBrowser Guard\nPokki\nSmart Panel\nSpyware and adware\nVisual Discovery by Superfish\nAntivirus or ad-blocking software\nAvast\nMcAfee\nNorton\nAVG\nAdBlock Plus\nTemporarily turning off your antivirus or ad-blocking software may help you troubleshoot your connection issue. If this fixes the issue,\ncheck to make sure that Slack is allowed by that software\n.\nStill having trouble?\nIf you’re unable to resolve your connection issue,\nget in touch\nand include a\nNet Log\nif possible.\nCheck connections\nSign in to your Slack workspace.\nVisit\nhttps://my.slack.com/help/test\nto check your network's connection to Slack.\nUnder the\nWebSockets\nsection, note the results for\nWebSocket (Flannel [Primary])\nand\nWebSocket (Flannel [Backup])\n.\n• A successful test will show the\nchecked circle icon.\n• A failed test will show the\nwarning icon.\nWho can use this feature?\nWorkspace Owners\nand\nAdmins\nAvailable on\nall plans\nAwesome!\nThanks so much for your feedback!\nIf you’d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to\nfeedback@slack.com\n.\nGot it!\nIf you’d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to\nfeedback@slack.com\n.\nIf you’d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to\nfeedback@slack.com\n.\nOops!
