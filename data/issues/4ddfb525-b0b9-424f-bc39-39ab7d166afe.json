Grant Zoom the permissions it needs. Close other apps that are using the Mac's camera and microphone.\nLike\nF\n1 person likes this\nReply\nJ\njoetall\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nMay 5, 2023\nMac hates Zoom now.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience you experienced. Can you kindly do a\nclean reinstall\nwith the latest version and let us know if the issue persists?\nLike\nReply\nShow 1 more reply\nD\ndrewrivera\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|8 months ago\nJune 4, 2025\ni have THE solution! i experienced the same issues, uninstalled, reinstalled, updated to latest macOS version, nothing worked. when i logged into my zoom account online, i clicked \"Host\" just because i wanted to see how zoom works online (rather than the app) to see if i can still utilize it. when i clicked \"Host\" it automatically downloaded a .pkg file to my computer, which has a different file name than the one from when i downloaded from\nhttps://zoom.us/download?os=mac\nand clicked \"Download for Apple Silicon\". the .pkg file that didn't work was called \"zoomusInstallerFull.pkg\" but the new one that DOES work is just \"Zoom.pkg\". went through the installation steps and everything works fine. zoom needs to update the download link on their site.\n1 reply\nLike\nP\n1 person likes this\nReply\nP\nProf1\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|6 months ago\nJuly 26, 2025\nThis was exactly what I needed!

Was very stable and working for many years. Suddenly, Zoom app won't launch. Even when I click the \"Launch Meeting\" button, nothing happens. I'm on Windows 10 and Chrome (latest updates for both). I've tried everything: Restarted PC, Cleared cookies, cleared cache, uninstalled and re-installed the Zoom app, including \"Cleanzoom\", verified camera and mic permissions, verified updated drivers on camera, even tried editing the \"Preferences\" file in the default directory as someone has suggested. Nothing has worked and I keep having the same issue. I have another (slightly older) laptop running same Windows/Chrome and everything works perfectly there. Can someone please suggest a solution? Thanks for your support.\nOther\nLike\nS\nJ\n2 people like this\nReply\nFollow\nBest answer by\np789jsb\nHi\n@p789jsb\n,\nOne common thread I have seen related to video and sound issues while using the browser/PWA is you have to make sure to give the browsers access to the camera and mic.\nHere are the instructions:\nChrome Users\nhttps://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2693767?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\nFirefox Users\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-manage-your-camera-and-microphone-permissions\nHope this is helpful\nI found the solution!\nThis problem I was having is a known bug in the most current release, and will be fixed when the next Release 5.16.10 is out (by end of month). In the interim, if anyone is having this issue, just download and install an older Release, I installed 5.15.11 and everything works like a charm.

This is the same as using the \"Join from your browser\" option on the Zoom screen when the app failed to launch. If someone can figure out why video doesn't work using this process, that would also be helpful.\nThe Zoom Web App (\"Zoom PWA\") appears to be designed for mobile platforms only (Android/IOS). I am able to use Zoom perfectly well on my iPhone without the PWA app, so my issue is simply limited to the desktop PC. Since our calls often involved lots of screen sharing of data and Excel spreadsheets, I need my 32\" desktop monitor and keyboard and am really limited on my little iPhone.\nJust checking online, I see that many other users are having the same issues as me (including no video on the browser version), so I'm hoping someone out there knows how to fix it!\n6 replies\nLike\nJ\n1 person likes this\nReply\nnewl\nEducation Ambassador\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nNovember 7, 2023\nHi\n@p789jsb\n,\nOne common thread I have seen related to video and sound issues while using the browser/PWA is you have to make sure to give the browsers access to the camera and mic.\nHere are the instructions:\nChrome Users\nhttps://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2693767?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\nFirefox Users\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-manage-your-camera-and-microphone-permissions\nHope this is helpful\nLike\nReply\nShow 5 more replies\nN\nNarwhal\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nNovember 20, 2024\nI had this problem too!

Now, in the past month, the Launch Meeting button doesn't work.  I have to launch my Zoom app first, and then click the button, sometimes multiple times, before it launches. A couple of our webinar panelists have reported the same issue with getting into webinars.  Others have mentioned similar issues.\nWhat has changed, that we can no longer launch meetings and webinars without a bunch of time-consuming hoop-jumping? Zoom, please fix this.\nLisa\nLike\nH\nL\nB\n12 people like this\nReply\nFollow\nBest answer by\nLisaSp\nI think I discovered the cause of the issue. The problem seems to occur if Zoom isn’t already running in the background (e.g., from Windows startup).  For anyone experiencing this issue, to fix: Go into the Zoom desktop app, (1) go into\nSettings\n, (2) select\nGeneral\n, and then (3) make sure both of these checkboxes are selected:\nStart Zoom when I start Windows\nand\nSilently start Zoom when I start Windows\n. You can close the window, but don't quit the program. Otherwise, the issue will continue.\nFor me, I think these checkboxes were inadvertently unchecked on my computer during some troubleshooting of another issue a month ago.\nL\nLisaSp\nAuthor\nAnswer\nExplorer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nOctober 3, 2022\nI think I discovered the cause of the issue. The problem seems to occur if Zoom isn’t already running in the background (e.g., from Windows startup).  For anyone experiencing this issue, to fix: Go into the Zoom desktop app, (1) go into\nSettings\n, (2) select\nGeneral\n, and then (3) make sure both of these checkboxes are selected:\nStart Zoom when I start Windows\nand\nSilently start Zoom when I start Windows\n.

I've found that when I use the \"join from your browser\" option (because Client won't load) that my video and audio will test ok, but as soon as I join a meeting, my CPU is max'ed out. In that state, the controls don't work right, or the \"page is unresponsive\" text pops up and asks if I want to exit or wait. Audio/Video are choppy, nobody can hear me and the video freezes. I had one time when I'd removed Google Chrome and Zoom client (using the Cleanzoom Program) reinstalled both and it worked. App would open on command and meetings worked. A few weeks later, same old stuff. App won't open, have to join from my browser...which doesn't work.\nI am so far. The 32-bit version still seems to work enough to have a basic meeting at least.\nI know others started using previous versions before the bad update last September I believe, but I couldn't find a workable link for it in my search yet.\nLike\nR\n1 person likes this\nReply\nCarlaA\nCommunity Manager\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nOctober 23, 2023\nHi\n@Shields24601\n@nantucketbob\n, thank you for posting for the first time, and welcome to the Zoom Community!\nPlease provide us with the device type you are currently using so that I can better assist you.

Whenever I sign in the Zoom app, it in turn runs an instance of the default browser with all its settings. When the \"Launch Zoom\" button didn't work, I clicked on the three vertical dots in the upper right hand corner and clicked \"Open in Firefox.\" This brought up a new window with a Launch Zoom button that didn't work. I clicked on the three vertical dots in the upper right hand corner and then clicked on \"Extensions\". I had the Privacy badger extension installed, so I clicked on its \"Disable for this site\" button, reloaded my window and the Launch Zoom button now worked. In the course of debugging this problem, I found that my Android operating system had helpfully disabled all my Zoom permissions because I hadn't used it in awhile so I enabled them again.\nLike\nReply\nGetting Started\nCommunity Getting Started Guide\nCommunity Guidelines\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nLogin to the community\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nEnter your E-mail address.

I've found that when I use the \"join from your browser\" option (because Client won't load) that my video and audio will test ok, but as soon as I join a meeting, my CPU is max'ed out. In that state, the controls don't work right, or the \"page is unresponsive\" text pops up and asks if I want to exit or wait. Audio/Video are choppy, nobody can hear me and the video freezes. I had one time when I'd removed Google Chrome and Zoom client (using the Cleanzoom Program) reinstalled both and it worked. App would open on command and meetings worked. A few weeks later, same old stuff. App won't open, have to join from my browser...which doesn't work.\nLike\nReply\nShow 1 more reply\nCarlaA\nCommunity Manager\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nOctober 23, 2023\nHi\n@Shields24601\n@nantucketbob\n, thank you for posting for the first time, and welcome to the Zoom Community!\nPlease provide us with the device type you are currently using so that I can better assist you.

Whenever I sign in the Zoom app, it in turn runs an instance of the default browser with all its settings. When the \"Launch Zoom\" button didn't work, I clicked on the three vertical dots in the upper right hand corner and clicked \"Open in Firefox.\" This brought up a new window with a Launch Zoom button that didn't work. I clicked on the three vertical dots in the upper right hand corner and then clicked on \"Extensions\". I had the Privacy badger extension installed, so I clicked on its \"Disable for this site\" button, reloaded my window and the Launch Zoom button now worked. In the course of debugging this problem, I found that my Android operating system had helpfully disabled all my Zoom permissions because I hadn't used it in awhile so I enabled them again.\nLike\nReply\nGetting Started\nCommunity Getting Started Guide\nCommunity Guidelines\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nLogin to the community\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nEnter your E-mail address.

We got the one URL from our backend side and using that URL we are opens the zoom App and start the meeting. The issue was,\nWe got the URL\nWe open the zoom App\nMeeting was connected\nAfter few mins user taps the\nEnd\nbutton at top right corner.\nThen Now user taps the\nEnd Meeting\nbutton\nNow the loader was appearing and then again it goes to meeting page and meeting was not ended.\nIt’s repeated again and again for few times\nAfter 2 or 3 attempts finally meeting was ended.\n→ I have using latest version of zoom App and iOS 13.\nFor your further clarifications, I have attached the vide proof. Please check it. This is serious issue and our app is in live. So Please focus on it and share your thoughts.\nThanks!\ncarson.zoom\n(Carson)\nNovember 5, 2019,  1:31am\n62\nHi\nsaroroo123\n,\nThanks for the reply and thanks for the detail and video. First of all, just want to let you know that the new SDK release is now available, you may find the latest iOS SDK here:\nhttps://github.com/zoom/zoom-sdk-ios/releases/tag/v4.4.56624.1028\nRegarding the issue you are facing, are you getting any info in the console log when you tap “End Meeting”? Is the meeting successfully ended and then just magically start the meeting again? Is your startMeeting method being called several times?\nThanks!\nsaroroo123\n(Saravanakumar)\nNovember 5, 2019,  7:55am\n63\nHi Carson,\nThanks for the link and new release. I will check and let you know\nRegarding the issue,\nI want to tell you that, we have 2 apps.\nApp 1 (Currently this app is in live) → uses the App store Zoom App\n‎ZOOM Cloud Meetings on the App Store\n→ To connect the meeting using above URL.\nApp 2 → uses the Zoom SDK to connect the meeting\nCurrent Problem we are facing is\nApp 1\nthat using your Zoom Cloud meetings app. In above video, You can see user taps the\nvideo call\nthen\nNow our back end team generates the meeting ID and send the one URL like this URL **\nThen we are open this URL in web view and web view will open the your\nZoom Cloud meetings App\nto join the meeting\nOnce your\nZoom cloud meeting\napp open then meeting window will open and meeting was started. You can check this in above attached video.\nNow user going to taps\nEnd\nbutton at top right corner\nThen user taps\nEnd meeting\nbutton.\nNow the loader was appeared and keep loading for few mins then it goes to meeting window again with same meeting ID and meeting was not ended. You can check this in above video.\nAfter 2 or 3 attempts then finally meeting was ended.\nHere is my Answer regarding your questions,\nare you getting any info in the console log when you tap “End Meeting”?\n→ No. Because, we are open the your\nzoom cloud meetings\napp to connect the meeting. All further actions like end meeting are done by your zoom app. So How can I get the your zoom cloud meeting app log details ?\nIs the meeting successfully ended and then just magically start the meeting again?\n→ Yes. You can see above attached video meeting ended but it again goes to meeting window with same meeting ID\nIs your startMeeting method being called several times?\n→ No. We did not call any method. we just open the web view using above URL then its open\nZoom cloud meeting App\nand it connect the meeting.\nSo, Carson Honestly I am not sure where was the issue, whether your zoom cloud meeting app OR the issue is in my side. Also I am 100% sure we did not make any changes in our side. It’s all working fine few months ago. Currently we got this issue\nPlease check this and share your thoughts. Let me know if anything needed from side\nThanks!\ncarson.zoom\n(Carson)\nNovember 6, 2019,  2:11am\n64\nHi\nsaroroo123\n,\nWow. Thanks for all the details. Really appreciate it. It looks like the issue is happening on the official Zoom client, so I would need to forward this to the client team(I mainly work on the SDK). I will try to find someone to help you further on this or get back to you with updates.\nThanks!\nsaroroo123\n(Saravanakumar)\nNovember 6, 2019,  7:32am\n65\nHi Carson,\nThanks for the reply. Between, I have used the new zoom SDK version and that UIWebView issue was fixed on that version. Thanks Carson.\nI am waiting for the zoom client. Please do it as soon as possible. Our app is in currently live\nCarson, I want to say this, we have this same issue in Zoom SDK too. Once I tapped end meeting then meeting window disappeared then after few seconds then again goes to the meeting window with same meeting ID.\nI did not get any log in my console\nI check few times when I tapped end meeting then its called onMeetingEndedReason() method and onMeetingStateChange() method I got state is 2.\nAfter few seconds again meeting window gets appeared with same meeting ID then I got the state 1 in onMeetingStateChange() method.\nI am 100% sure Start meeting method called only first time and only once.\nIn order to reproduce this issue means, please join the meeting then wait for 1 min then end the meeting. Now check the action. if issue was not reproduce means please repeat this more than 3 or 4 times. You must got the issue.\nhere is the video proof of zoom SDK issue -->\nhttps://streamable.com/z3o7a\nIn this video you can see, I was tapped end meeting and it again goes to meeting page with same meeting ID.\nCarson, I also need to say this, we got this issue more times with 0 participants. In other words there no participants are joined in that meeting. Only meeting creator (host) is joined this meeting.\nPlease check with zoom iOS SDK and share your thoughts\nThanks!\ncarson.zoom\n(Carson)\nNovember 7, 2019, 12:47am\n66\nHi\nsaroroo123\n,\nThanks for the reply. I have forwarded the info to the Zoom client team and tried my best to escalate this. They have identified this issue and added this to their fix plan. Please wait for the official update on the App Store.\nThanks!\nsaroroo123\n(Saravanakumar)\nNovember 7, 2019,  7:10am\n67\nHi Carson,\nThanks for the reply. what about zoom SDK because I got this same issue in zoom SDK too ?\ncarson.zoom\n(Carson)\nNovember 7, 2019, 11:20pm\n68\nHi saroroo123,\nI will work with our engineer to see if there is any workaround. Our SDK is using the same component that the Zoom client is using as well, and it is out of the scope that our SDK can modify so I am afraid we cannot fix it on the SDK side. Once they have fixed this on the client-side, our SDK will inherit the fix as well. Sorry for the inconvenience.\nThanks!\nsaroroo123\n(Saravanakumar)\nNovember 8, 2019,  6:52am\n69\nHi Carson,\nThanks for the reply. I will waiting for the zoom client fix.

Currently I am facing some issues. Please check it below\nMeeting window not appeared while join the meeting\nApp get crashed while host end the meeting .\nDetailed Description:\nMeeting window not appeared while join the meeting\nI am trying to join the meeting. I have the meeting ID. I used this code to join the meeting,\nlet paramDict = [\nkMeetingParam_Username: AppConstants.ClassConstants.activeUserName,\nkMeetingParam_MeetingNumber: AppConstants.ClassConstants.inComingCallMeetingID,\n**            ]**\nlet response: MobileRTCMeetError? = service?.joinMeeting(with: paramDict)\nMeeting was created in zoom web app. I am trying to join the meeting from using my mobile.\nI was joined the meeting and I did not get any error codes and also my mobile camera was showing my face and I can see my face in zoom web app. But the problem is, in mobile meeting window page not appeared. In other words, Meeting window page not opened but my mobile camera was start capturing my movements.\nI don’t know why meeting window was not appeared. Please tell me if anything I am missing here OR is anything I need to update ?\nApp get crashed while host end the meeting.\nTake above scenario. I created meeting using web app and meeting started and participant joined via mobile using zoom SDK .\nNow, I am the host and I am going to tap the end meeting button.\nNow, in mobile side. I mean participant side. App get crashed. I could not get the crash report but I can see this error in my compiler view.\n40 PM\n1822×444 66.3 KB\nEach time app get crashed while host end the meeting. Please check it and share your thoughts\nMy Device Configurations:\nZoom SDK --> [v4.4.56624.1028]\nMac Os     -->  Version 10.15.1 (macOS Catalina)\nXCode      --> 11.2.1\nDevice      —> iPhone X\niOS          —> 13.2.3\nThanks. Let me know your thoughts\nOne More thing: I got issue in my compiler.\nCannot retrieve the container URL for the application group identifier . Make sure that it has been added to the\ncom.apple.security.application-groups\nentitlement.\nI did not use any group IDs in my application and also I set this code in my appdelegate class.\nlet context = MobileRTCSDKInitContext()\ncontext.domain = AppConstants.ZoomKeys.Zoom_Domain\ncontext.enableLog = true\ncontext.appGroupId = “”\n@Carson\n. Please check it. I already referred this link -->\nHaving Crash while starting zoom class\nBut no use of this. Still I am getting this error while join the meeting. What can I do now ?\ncarson.zoom\n(Carson)\nNovember 26, 2019,  3:05am\n76\nHi\nsaroroo123\n,\nHappy Monday and thanks for the reply. Regarding the issue you are facing:\nBased on the screenshot you have provided, it seems like the issue is not from our SDK. Using UIAlertController instead of UIAlertView could fix this issue\nRegarding the entitlement issue, normally if you set up a group ID, Xcode will create the entitlement file for you, for some reason Xcode is not creating this for your project and this issue appears. Please double-check if our group ID “group.us.zoom” does not appear in your code, and use your own group ID instead. If you do not need the screen sharing feature, you do not need the group ID(do not set it in MobileRTCSDKInitContent), and you do not need the broadcast extension.\nHope this helps. Thanks!\nsaroroo123\n(Saravanakumar)\nNovember 26, 2019,  9:58am\n77\nHi\n@carson.zoom\n,\nThanks for your replay. I need to say this please check Zoom SDK in Latest xCode 11.2.1. There is in crash issue in UIAlertView. I think you are using UIAlertView. In Latest xCode 11.2.1 --> UIScene class not supports UIAlertView. So App get Crashed. I am 100% sure, I am not use UIAlertView in my applications. I got this crash while calling zoom SDK. So Please check your SDK with Latest xCode 11.2.1 OR make support zoom SDK in 11.2.1.\nLet me know your thoughts. Thanks\nAnother question:\nWhen meeting window appeared.

Regarding the UIAlertView issue, I have passed this to our engineering team and we will investigate this further.\nRegarding the audio auto connect issue, normally if you set the\nsetAutoConnectInternetAudio\nto be true, then it will auto connect the audio upon joining the meeting. Based on the error message shown in the screenshot, it seems like there are multiple devices that are producing errors at the moment(Maybe you have multiple devices next to each other joining the same meeting at the same time?), and when this happens, the audio will disconnect automatically.\nHope this helps. Thanks!\nsaroroo123\n(Saravanakumar)\nNovember 27, 2019, 11:30am\n79\nHi\n@carson.zoom\n,\nThanks for the reply. Regarding audio it’s working fine now and also I forget to tell you one thing regarding zoom call not ending and meeting window opened again issue, now it’s working fine. Thanks a lot Carson.\nCurrently I am waiting for the UIAlertView issues only.\nThanks\ncarson.zoom\n(Carson)\nNovember 27, 2019,  8:25pm\n80\nHi\nsaroroo123\n,\nGlad to hear that those are working well now! Regarding the UIAlertView issue, please have a try to build your SDK project with Xcode 10 and see if it helps.\nThanks!\n← previous page\nnext page →\nRelated topics\nTopic\nReplies\nViews\nActivity\nI am unable to view/share my video to the participant.

Every 5 minutes or so, the wifi simply stops for 5 seconds.  I have not actually timed the interval between the stoppages, but it seems to match the frequency report by Kwikfab04.  I had Resource Monitor running and took a picture of it (screenshot doesn't work with Resource Monitor running) when the event occurred. See the attached picture.  There is no indication of a spike in CPU, disk, or memory preceding or simultaneous with the wifi drop.  It lasts 5 seconds and I usually get the \"network unstable\" message at the end.  I have a wired laptop as well and I don't see the same drop for it.  So my suspicion is that it the wifi simply stops to do some housekeeping or something for 5 seconds.  Router is a Netgear Orbi AC3000 mess with one RBR50 and one RBS50.  Netgear support is UTTERLY USELESS, so I'm trying Zoom support in hopes of finding someone else who had the problem.\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nK\nKwikfab04\nAuthor\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nMarch 20, 2024\nThanks for the reply but if you read my initial post, I am on LAN.

Low utilization, connect to a fiber-optic LAN (not wifi). I also have intermittent (and frequent) freezing during Zoom calls.  No solution yet, but I can add one additional piece of information:  This doesn't happen when I use my phone to dial into the Zoom call rather than use computer audio. This ONLY happens when using computer audio, so there clearly is a connection but I'm not technical enough to figure out a solution.\nLike\nM\n1 person likes this\nReply\nR\nRaul1726\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nMay 20, 2024\nI am also facing the same issues since a long time. the zoom is freezing in my Pc with a ryzen 9 5900x 128GB ram connected via LAN cable and the zoom doesn't not freeze when using the lower end laptop connected via wifi to the same internet connection. so i am not able to understand the actual issue with the app.\nkindly help me with the issue its effecting my work drastically.\nLike\nReply\nS\nsongdan72\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nAugust 14, 2024\nI'm having the same issue.

Zoom, an online meeting platform, became the most popular among such services for its ability\n              to host an unlimited number of participants and other functions.\nUnfortunately, it seems like instances of crashing have rampant even in this new world of work.\nIn this pandemic era, communication with your team and people in your workplace is crucial.\nNot only is it frustrating to deal with faulty telecommunication apps, but these technical issues are\n              frustrating to deal with and could affect your professional rapport especially when meeting prospects.\nIf the Zoom app continually crashes, freezes, unable to connect to audio or camera, or worse, kicks you\n              out on meetings, then you might want to check several things. In this article, we'd listed the three\n              primary reasons behind these issues.\n1. Unstable Internet Connection\nSince Zoom relies solely on your internet connection, it might be the culprit why the app crashes all the\n              time.\nAs the service transfers video and audio concurrently, the need for a reliable and robust internet\n              connection is essential. If the internet is slow, your camera display or other participant's video feed\n              will freeze on your screen. While Zoom typically tries its best to preserve your audio during such\n              problems, the quality will be unclear, changes speed, and stutters.\nIf you're using WiFi, it might be that your device is too far away from the router or that your network is\n              congested. On the other hand, if you're on a wired connection, there might be a problem with the network\n              cable. Regardless, as\nZoom officially states\n, poor internet connection results in latency issues.\n2. Hardware Incompatibility\nThe hardware or device you're using can also cause Zoom to crash. First, since the app requires\nminimum operating system versions\n, using older or unsupported ones will yield incompatibility issues. Consequently, necessary functions\n              won't work due to missing system features, or the app won't run at all.\nAside from OS versions, there are also required types of browsers and devices. If Zoom runs on unsupported\n              technologies, it can't use the system's camera or microphone well. Besides, older tech typically has bugs\n              and issues that will likely affect the app's performance.\nIf Zoom can't connect with the device's sensors, use certain features, or run in the first place, consider\n              it due to hardware incompatibility.\n3. System Overload\nSimilar to hardware incompatibility, slow or overloaded system can cause Zoom crashing.\nSince the app requires a significant portion of your device's memory, opening multiple applications and\n              windows can affect how it runs. Also, if you're using another program that utilizes the same sensors as\n              Zoom, it might conflict with each other and make the camera or microphone inaccessible. If there are many\n              things in the background, the system might freeze and force close resource-hogging entities such as Zoom.\nIf there are different active programs, your device's internet speed will be shared and divided several\n              times. As a result, Zoom will receive less network allocation that can cause video and audio to degrade\n              and crash.\nIs it Time for a New App?\nSometimes, technology just doesn't cooperate. If you find that Zoom continues to give you more issues, you\n              might want to consider switch platforms entirely.\nHere at Velox, we are proud to offer superior quality audio alongside economical prices for small\n                businesses in Singapore.\nGet in touch\nto find out more about our virtual phone systems and how it can help your business!\nTAGS:\nNone\nContact us for

Also, many users complain about connection, camera, audio, or recording\nZoom issues\n.\nWe understand your struggles, therefore we’ve created a complete\nZoom troubleshooting\nguide on the nine\nmost common reasons why\nZoom is not working\nand the simplest ways to fix the problems\n.\nProblem: Zoom is Repeatedly Lagging and Freezing\nWrong settings and unstable connection are the most common reasons for a\nZoom lag\n. Luckily, they are easily fixable with one of these two solutions.\nSolution 1: Opt for the best connection\nFor a phone or another mobile device, you can try moving closer to your router or switching to another Wi-Fi network with a stronger signal. PC users should try a wired Ethernet connection and change the router settings to 5GHz. With a higher data rate, you’ll face fewer\nZoom freezes\n.\nSolution 2: Reduce your outgoing traffic\nIn some cases, a\nglitch\ncan happen even with a high-speed internet connection. Other open apps can be streaming, downloading, and uploading data, taking up the device’s bandwidth, which may result in\nZoom lagging\n.\nThen follow these steps to reduce outgoing traffic:\nOpen\nZoom\nand click on the cog icon and pick\nVideo Settings\n.\nChoose the\nVideo\ncategory on the left.\nUncheck\nHD\nand\nTouch Up My Appearance\nsettings.\nProblem: Zoom Can’t Connect to Server\nThe source of Zoom glitches is often rooted in connectivity issues. Here are four methods you can try.\nSolution 1: Test your Internet speed\nFor starters, try connecting another device to see if it will have the same problem. If it does, your network is the most likely source of the problem.\nUse the free\nGoogle Internet Speed Test\nto find out upload and download speeds. If it’s\nless than 1 Mbps\n, it can be a reason for Zoom connection problems.\nSolution 2: Clean up the temp files\nEvery digital device stores temporary files and some of them may be corrupted. In this case, rebooting is the easiest way to\nfix Zoom connection issues\n.\nTurn off the router and your current device, then unplug them from a power socket, if possible. Wait for 2-3 minutes and plug them back.\nSolution 3: Use Windows Troubleshooter\nWindows Troubleshoot is a built-in tool that finds and fixes the most common system issues, including connection problems:\nGo to the search bar and type\nTroubleshoot Settings\n.\nSelect\nAdditional troubleshooters\n.\nStart the\nNetwork Adapter\nwith the\nRun\nbutton.\nYou can also run\nInternet Connections\n,\nIncoming Connections\n, and\nBluetooth\ntroubleshooter\ns.\nSolution 4: ​​Change your IP address\nIP conflict is another common reason for Zoom glitches. Fixing this may look complicated, but it’s pretty simple:\nWrite\nCMD\nin the search bar to invoke the\nCommand Prompt\napp.\nRight-click on the application and choose\nRun as administrator\n.\nPaste the command:\nipconfig /release and p\nress\nEnter\nto confirm.\nWait until you see the cursor and paste the command:\nipconfig /renew\nPress\nEnter\nto confirm it.\nRestart the computer and launch\nZoom\n.\nProblem: Internal Zoom Server Issues\nSometimes\na device fails to create a stable connection with the Zoom server due to network issues,\nZoom firewall error,\nor application glitches.\nSolution 1: Temporarily disable the firewall/proxy\nZoom blocked by a firewall\nis not a rare case. Contact your network administrator to check firewall and proxy settings. Temporarily disable those settings or change to default values. It could be an error code 100000404.\nSolution 2: Change firewall rules for Zoom\nUse the\nofficial Zoom firewall chart\nto configure a network firewall. Apply those\nZoom firewall settings/ ports\non your device.\nSolution 3: Check VPN or antivirus\nIf you are experiencing general connectivity problems you might have 5000, 5003, 5004, 104101, 104102,104103,…,104125 errors. To solve them\ncheck your VPN, firewall, and proxy to exclude potential causes of\nZoom error code 5003\nand other codes from this group.\nDisable the antivirus for 10-15 minutes and connect to Zoom.\nProblem: Video or Audio Isn’t Working\nJoining the meeting to find out that your\nvideo is not working on Zoom\nmay be very annoying. Make sure your camera and speakers are working: maybe you’ve disabled them at the previous meeting or have recently updated the privacy settings.\nSolution 1: Close conflicting apps\nIf your\nvideo camera is not working on Zoom,\nit can be caused by other apps that can use a camera,e.g. Another communication app or video editing tools. Shut down those apps and relaunch Zoom.\nSolution 2: Change settings to allow cam/mic use\nSometimes your Zoom camera is glitching because you have previously turned it off in the settings.\nWindows 10\nHere is how you can check camera permissions on\nWindows 10\n:\nClick on the\nWindows\nlogo.\nClick on the gear icon to open\nSettings\n.\nChoose\nPrivacy → Camera\n.\nTurn on the “\nAllow apps to access your camera\n” toggle. You’ll see the list of apps in “\nChoose which desktop apps can access your camera\n”.\nScroll down until you see the\nZoom\napp. Turn on the toggle.\nIf your\nZoom audio is not working on Windows 10,\nuse the same guide, but instead of\nCamera\nchoose\nMicrophone\n. Make sure that you turn it on and allow Zoom to use it.\nWindows 11\nIf\nZoom audio is not working\non\nWindows 11\n, use this instruction:\nClick on\nWindows\nand pick a gear icon.\nChoose\nPrivacy & Security → Microphone\n.\nTurn on the\nLet apps access your microphone\noption. Find a\nLet desktop apps access your microphone\nlist.\nScroll down until you find the\nZoom\napplication. Turn the setting on.\nmacOS\nStick to this instruction to check macOS Zoom privacy settings:\nGo to\nSystem Settings\n.\nChoose\nPrivacy & Security\n.\nFind the\nCamera\nin the lefthand menu.\nLook for Zoom in the “\nAllow the apps below access to your camera\n” list and mark it.\nIf your\nZoom audio is not working on Mac,\ntry this guide:\nClick on the\nApple\nlogo and find\nSystem Preferences\n.\nChoose the\nSound\noption.\nGo to the\nInput\ntab.\nSelect the audio device and change both input and output levels.\nYou can also adjust the microphone volume directly on Zoom. Click on the gear icon to open\nSettings\n. Go to the\nAudio\ntab and move sliders to set the volume level to your liking.\nSolution 3: Turn on the video/audio on Zoom\nYou may ask yourself\n“\nWhy is my video not working on Zoom\n, but fine in other applications?” and seek answers in other apps while the problem is in Zoom settings.\nEvery time you join the\nmeeting with a working camera, you see a “\nTurn off my video\n” pop-up with a “\nDon’t remind me\n” option. Once you tick this box, your camera will be automatically switched off for all the following chats. Here is how you can turn it back on:\nOpen the\nZoom\napplication.\nClick on the gear to open\nSettings\n.\nFind the\nVideo\nin the lefthand menu.\nUncheck the “\nTurn off my video when joining the meeting\n”.\nWhen your incoming\naudio is not working on Zoom,\nopen Settings and choose Audio. Uncheck the “\nTurn off my microphone\n”. One of the most popular reasons\nwhy Zoom audio is not working\nis that you turn it down at a previous meeting.\nSolution 4: Use a web-based testing tool\nTry a test video chat. Follow this\nlink\nand click on the “Launch Meeting” virtual button. It opens a Zoom app where you can test your camera, microphone, and speakers.\nProblem: Sound Echo\nEcho is a common Zoom audio problem. In most cases, the issue’s source is in basic overlapping when multiple devices provide audio for the same meeting. It also happens when you place external speakers too close to the microphone. Check what devices may interfere and disable them.\nSolution: One call - one audio device\nCheck for other devices connected to the meeting: phones, tablets, or loud external speakers. Temporarily disable audio on those devices.\nIf you are in the room with people present at the same meeting, ask them to wear headphones or mute audio on their devices.\nProblem: Can’t Share Screen\nSometimes you need to share your screen to show colleagues valuable information. Unfortunately, the application may catch a\nZoom screen-sharing lag.\nIt happens with an outdated app or if you’ve earlier disabled this feature.\nSolution 1: Enable screen sharing\nCheck that you’ve enabled this feature for your account. Follow this instruction to troubleshoot\nnot working screen share on Zoom\n:\nSign in to the desktop\nZoom\nversion.\nGo to\nSettings\nand open the\nMeeting\ntab.\nFind\nIn Meeting (Basic)\nand select\nScreen Sharing\n.\nSwitch the toggle to\nEnable\n.\nThis action allows the screen-sharing feature on your account. If you are a group admin, you can enable it for all its members:\nSign in to\nZoom\nunder the group administrator account.\nOpen the navigation menu and choose\nUser Management\n. Select\nGroups\n.\nFind the group where you need to change settings.\nPick the\nMeeting\ntab.\nFind In\nMeeting (Basic)\nand choose\nScreen Sharing\n.\nTurn on the\nEnable\ntoggle. This action allows every group member to launch a screen share.\nSolution 2: Allow screen sharing for everyone\nThe disabled screen-share feature is the most common reason why everyone in a meeting is\nunable to share a screen in Zoom\n.\nIf you are the host of the meeting, check the settings and enable this feature. Use this guideline to fix the issue:\nLog into\nZoom\nand launch the meeting.\nGo to the control’s toolbar and find a\nShare screen\ngreen icon. Click on the gray upward arrow icon next to it.\nSelect\nAdvanced Sharing Options\n.\nFind\nWho can share\nand choose\nAll members\n.\nIf you use a mobile, you have another instruction to fix the\nnot working Zoom screen share\n:\nLaunch the\nZoom\napp.\nTap on the screen to see meeting controls.\nTap on three dots to open the sub-menu.\nChoose\nSecurity\n.\nEnable the\nShare Screen toggle\n.\nTap\nClose\nto save changes.\nIf you are a regular member, you can’t change the meeting’s settings. Please ask the host to do this for you.\nSolution 3: Try universal techniques\nIf you have already tried both methods from above but still\ncan’t share screen on Zoom\n, here are general troubleshooting measures you can turn to. These are the most user-friendly solutions that require only 10-20 minutes of your time:\n• Restart the device. While working, it produces temporary files, which may be corrupted. Restarting removes those files, which should fix most of the\nZoom issues\n.\n• Update the Zoom app. The outdated app version may cause all sorts of glitches, including screen share problems.\n• Clear system cache and cookies. You can use built-in tools or third-party apps.\n• If nothing else has worked, reinstall the app.\nSolution 4: Reset access permissions\nmacOS has enhanced privacy settings, due to which users may ask themselves “\nWhy can’t I share my screen on a Zoom\ndesktop? It works just fine on my phone”. To change privacy settings on your computer, go to\nSystem Preferences\n→\nPrivacy\nand make sure that Zoom has permission for screen recording.\nProblem: Can’t Use Zoom Remote Control\nWhile sharing a screen, other users can also\nrequest remote device control on Zoom\nto help you troubleshoot your machine without installing remote control software.\nEnable this feature by clicking the\nRequest Remote\nbutton in the\nView Options\nmenu. Try these troubleshooting measures to fix the\nnot working Zoom remote contro\nl.\nSolution 1: Switch to the desktop app\nUnfortunately, there is no option to get remote access for iOS or Android devices as this feature will only work for the Zoom desktop applications.\nIf your\nZoom\nremote\ncontrol is not working on a Mac\nwhile you are trying to access another person’s iPad over a distance, check out other apps for\nmobile device troubleshooting.\nSolution 2: Don’t touch the controllers\nOnce you allow another person to remotely connect to your device, don’t touch your keyboard or mouse. If you do, It will immediately terminate the remote access session and you will need to activate it manually again.\nSolution 3: Turn on the remote control feature\nCheck if the person sharing their screen has allowed\nremote control\n.

It’s a common situation, thus we are going to share with you three efficient ways to prevent\ncrashing Zoom\n.\nSolution 1: Check for the app outages\nZoom connection glitches may happen due to Zoom’s server issues. If your app continues to crash no matter what you are doing, type “\nIs Zoom down\n?” or “\nZoom connection issues today\n” on your favorite search engine. Or you can straightaway go to\ndowndetector.com\nor similar sites to check if there are any global or local outages.\nSolution 2: Switch to the web version\nOpen the Zoom\nwebsite\nand use a web version. Some updates interfere with the device, which may lead to various glitches.\nSolution 3: Delete files from the cache\nAs we said before, corrupted temporary files are a common reason for Zoom glitches.\nClear the Zoom cache\nto remove those files from your device.\nWindows\nOpen\nFile Explorer\n.\nFollow this path:\nC:/Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/Zoom\n.\nRight-click on the\nData\nfolder and click\nDelete\n.\nmacOS\nOpen\nFinder\n. Click the\nFinder\nicon or press\nCMD (⌘) + Space\nand type\nFinder\nin the search bar.\nFind the menu bar at the top of the screen, click\nGo\nand select\nGo to Folder\n.\nOnce you see the pop-up, enter\n/Library/Application Support/zoom.us\nDouble-click to open the\nZoom\nfolder.\nRight-click on the data folder and select\nMove to Trash\n.\nGoogle Chrome\nOpen the browser and click the 3 dots icon.\nChoose\nSettings\n→\nPrivacy & Security\n.\nClick\nClear browsing data\n.

There is no tool for cache removal, so you should delete the app and reinstall it:\nOpen\nSettings\n→\nGeneral\n.\nChoose\nGeneral → iPhone Storage → Zoom → Delete\n.\nReinstall it from the\nApp Store\n.\nProblem: Recording Feature Doesn’t Work\nAre you trying to record the meeting, but this feature doesn’t work? Check the app permissions to find out why\nZoom recording audio is not working.\nSolution 1: Change settings to allow recording\nYou should be a host to have the ability to record Zoom meetings. If you don’t have permission to record a meeting, the system doesn’t allow you to do it. It’s the most common reason for questions like “\nWhy can’t I record on Zoom?\n”.\nOrdinary users can record meetings only if the host gives them permission from the\nParticipants\nmenu by clicking on the\nMore\nbutton and choosing the\nAllow Record\noption.\nSolution 2: Use a system screen recorder\nIf you need to record the meeting and don’t have time or desire to troubleshoot Zoom, use built-in Windows or macOS recorders. They can record both audio and video.\nConclusion\nWe hope that our troubleshooting solutions will help you fix Zoom issues on your device. If you still face Zoom glitches, it may be some severe hardware issue. In any case, feel free to request help from HelpWire.

Clear Zoom’s cache by navigating to %appdata%\\Zoom and deleting its contents. Check for conflicting software or firewall settings blocking Zoom. Reinstalling the app can resolve corrupted files. Also, verify Windows 11 updates are current, as outdated system files may cause compatibility issues. Running Zoom as administrator can help bypass permission restrictions preventing meeting launches.\nDisclaimer:\nThis information is AI-generated and intended for general guidance only.

If I start a new call without other participants, it won't freeze. As soon as someone joins, it crashes. If I join an ongoing call with other participants already present, it will crash within a few seconds. It typically crashes in a way that I can still see and hear other participants, but I cannot click any of the call control options and Windows considers the program to be \"not responding.\"\nI've attempted an additional reinstall of Zoom without success.\nZoom v 6.2.6 (49050) Windows 11 23H2 22631.4391\nRead more\nShare\nTop Posts\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of October 30, 2024\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of October 2024\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2024\nReddit Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nUser Agreement\nYour Privacy Choices\nAccessibility\nReddit, Inc. © 2026.

ago\nSeptember 14, 2021\nThe Zoom client has been working perfectly on my desktop for months, including and up to yesterday.  Today when I try to start or join a meeting, it crashes.  The meeting window pops up briefly and then closes.  It seems like Zoom tries again 2-3 times and then gives up.\nHave tried with camera on and off (same result)\nHave tried with multiple Zoom accounts\nHave tried uninstalling, restarting, reinstalling, restarting—all to no avail\nOther video apps on my computer work: OBS, MS Teams meetings, etc.\nThe client on my work laptop works with the same account (no crashes)\nHave cleared Windows temp files\nHave cleared Chrome cache\nNo idea what else to try!  It seems that Zoom is interacting with something else on my desktop but I can't figure out what it might be.  Nothing has changed since yesterday.\nLike\n1 person likes this\nReply\nFollow\nBest answer by\nyoshioka\nOn the Zoom site, when you reach the downloads page, the default link is for the 32 bit version.  Underneath you should see the link for the 64 bit version.  I just ran into this with one f our Windows users too.\nStefanScherbik\nCommunity Champion | Customer\nForum|Forum|4 years

meeting open.  As long as I didn't do anything with that dialog box, the meeting window stayed open, with camera working.  Left it like that for several minutes.  As soon as I tell it to close the previously open meeting, it crashes again.\nNote that with this same account, I can open and close meetings from that same account freely.  It's almost like there's something\non this computer\nthat's telling Zoom a meeting is still open.  Not sure if that even makes sense.\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nStefanScherbik\nCommunity Champion | Customer\nForum|Forum|4 years ago\nSeptember 14, 2021\nUpdating BIOS is different depending on the laptop.  For instance, at my company we have Dell laptops, so I can google \"Dell Latitude 5410 Drivers\" to get to the drivers page, and then search for BIOS, which gives me an .exe download for the BIOS driver for that model of laptop.  Then I run it, and it updates BIOS.  Might be a similar workflow if you google \"BIOS\" for your make/model of laptop.\nUnfortunately I have no idea about the \"other meeting open\" popup and the fact that it crashes once you close it.  Hopefully the 32 bit version people mentioned will help.\nLike\nReply\nRupert\nCommunity Champion | Customer\nForum|Forum|4 years ago\nSeptember 14, 2021\nHi\n@mbailey\nCheck to see if you have any pending Windows Updates.\nIf you are on a 64-bit computer, I'd also suggest making sure you are using the 64-bit version of Zoom.\nAlthough you have reinstalled Zoom, I'd also suggest you check you are on the latest version -  5.7.8\nHope this helps.\nRupert\n2 replies\nLike\nA\nC\nO\n3 people like this\nReply\nM\nmbailey\nAuthor\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|4 years ago\nSeptember 14, 2021\nThanks for your reply!  How can I tell if I have the 32-

2021\nThanks\n@yoshioka\nand\n@Rupert\n— reinstalling with the 64 bit client worked.  It seems there are a few different places where you can download the client, and not all of them give you the 64-bit option.\nI'm still perplexed as to what changed between yesterday (when it worked) and today (when it didn't).  However, after a day of fighting with it, I was able to find the 64-bit client to download and install, and all appears to be working normally now!\nLike\nReply\nGetting Started\nCommunity Getting Started Guide\nCommunity Guidelines\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms &

may receive emails from WebinarTV due to Chrome extensions like Zoomcoder and Zoom Easy Downloader. OIT recommends reporting these emails as phishing.","raw_content":"Zoom - Known Issues | Office of Information Technology\nSkip to main content\nOIT\nOffice of Information Technology\n|\nMenu\nNew Wi-Fi is here: Register now!\nZoom - Known Issues\nZoom Webinar hosts being contacted by WebinarTV\nIssue\nA Zoom Webinar host may be connected by sarah.blair@webinarTV.us from\nWebinarTV\n.\nResolution\nZoom and The University of Colorado Boulder are aware of this issue. The issue appears to be from Chrome extensions “Zoomcoder” and “Zoom Easy Downloader (ZED). People who may have these extensions enabled on their devices and join a webinar could trigger the email from WebinarTV to the Zoom host.\nOIT’s recommendation is to report any email from WebinarTV as phishing by notifying the security team. For information on how to report a phishing attempt please see\nPhishing Emails - Identify & Report Suspicious Messages\n.\nZoom third-party apps/bots can join meetings without an invite\nIssue\nZoom users have the ability to install third-party apps, integrations and bots to their individual accounts. Some of these third-party apps allow a Zoom user to add bots as a participant in every Zoom meeting they join. This can lead to confusion and concern for the host of the Zoom meeting.\nResolution\nOn Dec. 13, 2024, OIT began to\nrestrict access to AI assistant bots within Zoom and Microsoft 365\n. Restricting access to AI assistant bots will be an ongoing effort for OIT.\nIn the meantime, here are a few extra security measures you can put in place to prevent bots from joining your meeting:\nEnable the\nZoom waiting room feature\nfor Zoom meetings.\nIf your meeting is exclusively for CU Zoom users, set your meeting to\nrequire participants to authenticate\nin order to join.\nEnable\nblocking users in specific domains\n(e.g., otter.ai, read.ai, fireflies.ai).\nIf a bot has already joined the meeting, you can follow these steps to remove them:\nIn the Zoom meeting toolbar, click\nParticipants\n(people icon).\nFind the bot's name in the list and click the\nMore icon\n(three dots) next to their name.\nSelect\nRemove\nfrom the drop-down menu to remove the bot from the meeting.\nUnable to enable Zoom AI summaries from within Canvas Zoom integration\nIssue\nWhen using Zoom through Canvas, there is no option to enable Zoom AI Summaries for a Zoom meeting.\nImage\nWorkaround\nCurrently, to enable Zoom AI Summaries for Canvas, users must update those settings through the\nCU Boulder Zoom web portal\n.\nUpdate your personal settings:\nLog in to the CU Boulder Zoom web portal, then click\nSettings\nin the left sidebar. On the\nAI Companion\ntab, go to the\nMeeting\nsection, confirm that \"Meeting summary with AI Companion\" is toggled on, then toggle on \"Turn on meeting summary automatically when meetings start.\"\nImage\nUpdate your meeting's settings:\nFirst, create a meeting within the Canvas Zoom integration. Log in to the CU Boulder Zoom web portal, then click\nMeetings\nin the left sidebar. Locate the Zoom meeting you created and open the meeting details. Scroll down and click\nEdit this Meeting\n. On the\nEdit Meeting\npage, scroll down to the\nAI Companion\nsection, check the box to \"Automatically start meeting summary,\" then click\nSave\n.\nImage\nIssue with attendees field not automatically sending Zoom meeting invite\nIssue\nWhen adding someone to the \"Attendees\" field, it does not automatically send Zoom meeting invite.\nImage\nView of \"Attendees\" field from the Zoom web portal.\nImage\nView of \"Attendees\" field from Zoom Workplace.\nSolution\nZoom account must be integrated with Microsoft Office 365. Please see\nZoom - Integrate Meetings into Your Calendar\n.\nIssue with Big Sur in Large Lecture Halls\nIssue\nOIT has tested macOS \"Big Sur\" version 11.2 and has identified audio and video functionality issues with our\nLarge Lecture Hall\nAV systems.\nRecommendation\nAt this time, we recommend avoiding using devices with this operating system, as there may be complications with sound, in-room display and Zoom functionality.\nmacOS Big Sur screen sharing error\nIssue\nSome users running Big Sur on Apple machines may report that participants only see a black screen when attempting to share their screen in a meeting.\nWorkaround\nOIT may be able to assist in troubleshooting this issue. Please contact\noithelp@colorado.edu\nfor further assistance.\nmacOS 10.14 Mojave microphone and video access\nIssue\nSome users have issues with microphone and video access on macOS 10.14 Mojave.\nWorkaround\nDue to increased security and permissions with macOS 10.14 Mojave, you will be prompted to authorize the Zoom Desktop Client and Zoom Rooms to use your computer's microphone and camera. Click\nOK\nduring the initial request and you will be able to use your microphone and camera in Zoom. If you do not allow Zoom access during this initial prompt, or if the camera and microphone become disabled, please see the\nUsing Zoom client with macOS 10.14 Mojave\non Zoom's website.\nHome\nServices\nConferencing Services\nVideo Conferencing\nFAQ\nVoice Conferencing\nWeb Conferencing (Zoom)\nFAQ\nHelp\nGetting Started\nAI Companion\nAdditional Licenses\nCommon-Good

After 10-20 seconds or hang-up mouse input stops again and only fix I've found so far is this method. This doesn't occur with any other software. I am thinking this has to do with some setting related to mouse control, but I haven't found anything online about this yet.\nPlease see below step.\n1. Plug in the wireless USB keyboard/mouse?\n2. It is worked well.\n3. Execute ZOOM software. And then show login in window.\nAt this time, wireless USB keyboard/mouse does not work. Other function is worked well. Only wireless USB keyboard/mouse has problem.\nIf I unplug wireless USB dongle and plug it again, wireless USB keyboard/mouse is worked well. But, If I execute ZOOM software again, issue is duplicated again.\nThis issue is duplicated some wireless USB keyboard/mouse.?\nBut, If I connect wireless USB keyboard/mouse to motherboard USB port directly, it is no problem.\nThis symptom is happening to apply KVM swith board.\nChipset information\nKVM swith board chipset : ASIX Chipset AX68002\nProblem mouse IC chipset : A582\nSo, please check it find a solution about this issue.\nWe are looking forward to hearing from you soon.\nThanks,\nBest regards,\nMarvin Yang.\nLike\nA\n1 person likes this\nReply\nFollow\nA\nabartlett\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nAugust 24, 2022\nI have exactly the same issue.\nKVM with wireless mouse plugged in.\nWhenever I start a Zoom meeting my mouse stops responding.\nI have to unplug the wireless receiver dongle and plug it back in for it to start working again.\nHowever, once it is working again it doesn't drop out again for me (unlike the problem you're experiencing).\nThis only started happening for me sometime in the last 2-3 months.\nI'm pursuing an idea based on the power management settings for the mouse/USB controller possibly being the cause with the computer triggering the 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power. option.\nI'll post here if I make any progress.\n1 reply\nLike\nP\n1 person likes this\nReply\nA\nabartlett\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nDecember 1, 2022\nAn update: my 6-ish months of this problem have ended and Zoom now does not cut-off my mouse anymore.\nUnfortunately I can't give any guidance on what has fixed it other than to say it was NOT anything to do with power management settings as I didn't make any changes. I suspect there's been a Zoom client update made by my employer but I'm not able to confirm this. It might be worth checking with your IT dept (if you have one) to see if there are any patches to apply to Zoom.\nGood luck to everyone else in getting your problems resolved.\nLike\nReply\nZ\nzoomonopoly\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nNovember 12, 2022\nI have the same problem x 1 month.  Seems to have started with latest zoom update.  When I open the zoom launcher I get a beep sound and a message that my computer does not recognize a usb port (the port that the mouse is connected to), and my mouse freezes.  I have to unplug the mouse usb and replug it in to the computer, at which time I get another beep signaling it is recognized, and the mouse works again.  Does zoom have product support to help with unsolved problems?\nLike\nP\n1 person likes this\nReply\nA\nAoiSeirei\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nNovember 29, 2022\nHi Any fixes for this? I am using a wired mouse and it also happens to me everytime I launch zoom. whether via the app or via direct invite link\nLike\nReply\nR\nrice0378\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nJanuary 10, 2023\nI am not sure, if anyone has truly solved the mouse problem with Zoom, yet, so I figure that I would provide me own situation, for more data.\nzoom will freeze my Delux Ergo mouse (2.4 G USB; M618Plus), regardless of whether I open Zoom via the app, or access the zoom session via my university Canvas page or Google Calendar. Unplugging and plugging the USB back in does not work (I don’t even get the disconnect/reconnecting sounds that you normally get). I have to restart the computer to fix it, which is not ideal. This mouse used to have no issues, until about this Fall, when some updates to the App occurred. Even my IT career fiancé can’t seem to figure out why the program is doing it. He’s tried everything.\nI should say that, this is the newest model of this mouse and the model or 2, prior to that, I was using and had worked fine too, but encounters the same issue with Zoom.\nSo, I’ve had to often switch to a little cheap Logi tech mouse, for the day, which is not great for my wrist, but it will work, when my good ergo mouse is disabled.\nMaybe knowing something about each of these mice may help pinpoint to somewhere where this issue may lie.\nbeyond that, I really wish we could just go back to the version that didn’t disable the mice.\nThanks.\nLike\nReply\nZ\nzoomonopoly\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nJanuary 10, 2023\nWell, it looks like Zoom dumps off all their product support onto the users -- because that's how they roll.  It would be great if there was more competition in the online meeting marketplace.  A monopoly is bad for everyone -- it makes the company lazy because they have no motivation to improve and it makes consumers get stuck with poorly performing products.\nLike\nReply\nC\nccrenchaw\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nJanuary 17, 2023\nI am experiencing the same issue for the last several days and at first, didn't realize the issue only occurred when I was on zoom. I use a Logitech MX Master 2S wireless mouse. I would be great if Zoom would respond with a solution or workaround  --- I literally find myself stuck with mic open and then my dogs start barking and I'm unable to mute; my shortcut commands don't seem to work anymore either.

We're glad to have you here.\nPlease try the troubleshooting steps below:\n1. Check the Physical Connection\nFor Wired Mice:\nEnsure the USB cable is securely plugged into the computer.\nTry connecting the mouse to a different USB port to rule out issues with the current port.\nCheck the cable for any visible damage.\nFor Wireless Mice:\nEnsure the receiver is properly connected to the computer.\nCheck the mouse batteries (if applicable) and replace them if necessary.\nRe-pair the mouse with the receiver (for Bluetooth or wireless models).\n2. Test the Mouse on Another Computer\nIf possible, test the mouse on a different computer to see if it works correctly. If it does, the issue might be related to your original system.\n3. Update Mouse Drivers\nGo to Device Manager (Windows) or System Preferences (Mac), and check if there are any issues with the mouse driver (such as a yellow exclamation mark).\nRight-click the mouse under Mice and other pointing devices and select Update driver.\nFor macOS, ensure that macOS is up to date, as it might contain drivers for external devices.\n4. Check for Zoom-Specific Issues\nTest Zoom without the mouse: Try using Zoom with keyboard shortcuts (such as Ctrl + Alt + Shift + H for hiding the meeting controls) to see if the mouse disconnection still occurs.\nZoom settings: Go to Settings in Zoom and check if there are any settings that could be interfering with your mouse, such as hardware acceleration (which might conflict with certain graphics or input devices).\nTry using Zoom’s web version: See if the problem persists in the web browser version of Zoom.\n5. Check for System Updates\nEnsure that both your operating system and Zoom application are up to date. Sometimes, issues like this are resolved with updates or patches.\nFor Windows: Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update.\nFor macOS: Go to Apple Menu > System Preferences > Software Update.\nFor Zoom: Open the Zoom app, click on your profile picture, and select Check for Updates.\n6. Disable Power Saving Settings\nIn Windows, Power Settings might disable USB devices to save power, which can cause intermittent disconnections.\nGo to Control Panel > Power Options, and choose High performance or customize the power plan to prevent USB ports from being turned off.\nCheck in Device Manager (under Universal Serial Bus controllers) and ensure USB Root Hub has the option \"Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power\" unchecked.\n7. Disable Conflicting Software\nDisable or uninstall any third-party software that might interfere with your mouse, such as mouse management tools, screen recording software, or virtual desktop software.\nSome software like Zoom, Teams, or other video conferencing tools could conflict with each other, causing input devices to malfunction.\n8. Test in Safe Mode (Windows) or Safe Boot (Mac)\nWindows: Boot into Safe Mode to rule out any third-party software conflicts. Restart your PC and press F8 (or Shift + F8) to access Safe Mode.\nmacOS: Start in Safe Boot mode by holding the Shift key while restarting your Mac.\n9. Try a Different Mouse\nIf possible, test with a different mouse to see if the issue persists. This will help you determine if the problem is hardware-related or if it’s specific to your original mouse.\n10. Reinstall Zoom\nSometimes a corrupted installation of Zoom can cause peripheral issues. Try uninstalling and then reinstalling Zoom.\nOn Windows, go to Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program.\nOn macOS, drag the Zoom app to the trash and reinstall from the official website.\n11. Check for Background Processes\nSome background processes or applications (such as antivirus software) can interfere with your mouse. Try closing unnecessary programs or disabling your antivirus temporarily to check if the issue is resolved.\n12. Consider Hardware Issues\nIf the issue continues even after trying all the steps, the mouse itself or the USB port may be faulty. Test a different mouse or consider replacing the mouse.\nLet us know if this helps or if you need further assistance.\nLike\nReply\nGetting Started\nCommunity Getting Started Guide\nCommunity Guidelines\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nLogin to the community\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nEnter your E-mail address.

Seems to be randomly happening to several people in the office each day.  No firewall changes, etc. have been made.  Zoom support has yet to be able to figure it out.   Any thoughts from the Zoom Community would be appreciated, thanks!\nLike\nReply\nFollow\nA\nAugustWind\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nJuly 18, 2022\nThat's part of my issue as well.

After 10-20 seconds or hang-up mouse input stops again and only fix I've found so far is this method. This doesn't occur with any other software. I am thinking this has to do with some setting related to mouse control, but I haven't found anything online about this yet.\nPlease see below step.\n1. Plug in the wireless USB keyboard/mouse?\n2. It is worked well.\n3. Execute ZOOM software. And then show login in window.\nAt this time, wireless USB keyboard/mouse does not work. Other function is worked well. Only wireless USB keyboard/mouse has problem.\nIf I unplug wireless USB dongle and plug it again, wireless USB keyboard/mouse is worked well. But, If I execute ZOOM software again, issue is duplicated again.\nThis issue is duplicated some wireless USB keyboard/mouse.?\nBut, If I connect wireless USB keyboard/mouse to motherboard USB port directly, it is no problem.\nThis symptom is happening to apply KVM swith board.\nChipset information\nKVM swith board chipset : ASIX Chipset AX68002\nProblem mouse IC chipset : A582\nSo, please check it find a solution about this issue.\nWe are looking forward to hearing from you soon.\nThanks,\nBest regards,\nMarvin Yang.\nLike\nA\n1 person likes this\nReply\nFollow\nA\nabartlett\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nAugust 24, 2022\nI have exactly the same issue.\nKVM with wireless mouse plugged in.\nWhenever I start a Zoom meeting my mouse stops responding.\nI have to unplug the wireless receiver dongle and plug it back in for it to start working again.\nHowever, once it is working again it doesn't drop out again for me (unlike the problem you're experiencing).\nThis only started happening for me sometime in the last 2-3 months.\nI'm pursuing an idea based on the power management settings for the mouse/USB controller possibly being the cause with the computer triggering the 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power. option.\nI'll post here if I make any progress.\n1 reply\nLike\nP\n1 person likes this\nReply\nA\nabartlett\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nDecember 1, 2022\nAn update: my 6-ish months of this problem have ended and Zoom now does not cut-off my mouse anymore.\nUnfortunately I can't give any guidance on what has fixed it other than to say it was NOT anything to do with power management settings as I didn't make any changes. I suspect there's been a Zoom client update made by my employer but I'm not able to confirm this. It might be worth checking with your IT dept (if you have one) to see if there are any patches to apply to Zoom.\nGood luck to everyone else in getting your problems resolved.\nLike\nReply\nZ\nzoomonopoly\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nNovember 12, 2022\nI have the same problem x 1 month.  Seems to have started with latest zoom update.  When I open the zoom launcher I get a beep sound and a message that my computer does not recognize a usb port (the port that the mouse is connected to), and my mouse freezes.  I have to unplug the mouse usb and replug it in to the computer, at which time I get another beep signaling it is recognized, and the mouse works again.  Does zoom have product support to help with unsolved problems?\nLike\nP\n1 person likes this\nReply\nA\nAoiSeirei\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nNovember 29, 2022\nHi Any fixes for this? I am using a wired mouse and it also happens to me everytime I launch zoom. whether via the app or via direct invite link\nLike\nReply\nR\nrice0378\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nJanuary 10, 2023\nI am not sure, if anyone has truly solved the mouse problem with Zoom, yet, so I figure that I would provide me own situation, for more data.\nzoom will freeze my Delux Ergo mouse (2.4 G USB; M618Plus), regardless of whether I open Zoom via the app, or access the zoom session via my university Canvas page or Google Calendar. Unplugging and plugging the USB back in does not work (I don’t even get the disconnect/reconnecting sounds that you normally get). I have to restart the computer to fix it, which is not ideal. This mouse used to have no issues, until about this Fall, when some updates to the App occurred. Even my IT career fiancé can’t seem to figure out why the program is doing it. He’s tried everything.\nI should say that, this is the newest model of this mouse and the model or 2, prior to that, I was using and had worked fine too, but encounters the same issue with Zoom.\nSo, I’ve had to often switch to a little cheap Logi tech mouse, for the day, which is not great for my wrist, but it will work, when my good ergo mouse is disabled.\nMaybe knowing something about each of these mice may help pinpoint to somewhere where this issue may lie.\nbeyond that, I really wish we could just go back to the version that didn’t disable the mice.\nThanks.\nLike\nReply\nZ\nzoomonopoly\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nJanuary 10, 2023\nWell, it looks like Zoom dumps off all their product support onto the users -- because that's how they roll.  It would be great if there was more competition in the online meeting marketplace.  A monopoly is bad for everyone -- it makes the company lazy because they have no motivation to improve and it makes consumers get stuck with poorly performing products.\nLike\nReply\nC\nccrenchaw\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nJanuary 17, 2023\nI am experiencing the same issue for the last several days and at first, didn't realize the issue only occurred when I was on zoom. I use a Logitech MX Master 2S wireless mouse. I would be great if Zoom would respond with a solution or workaround  --- I literally find myself stuck with mic open and then my dogs start barking and I'm unable to mute; my shortcut commands don't seem to work anymore either.

We're glad to have you here.\nPlease try the troubleshooting steps below:\n1. Check the Physical Connection\nFor Wired Mice:\nEnsure the USB cable is securely plugged into the computer.\nTry connecting the mouse to a different USB port to rule out issues with the current port.\nCheck the cable for any visible damage.\nFor Wireless Mice:\nEnsure the receiver is properly connected to the computer.\nCheck the mouse batteries (if applicable) and replace them if necessary.\nRe-pair the mouse with the receiver (for Bluetooth or wireless models).\n2. Test the Mouse on Another Computer\nIf possible, test the mouse on a different computer to see if it works correctly. If it does, the issue might be related to your original system.\n3. Update Mouse Drivers\nGo to Device Manager (Windows) or System Preferences (Mac), and check if there are any issues with the mouse driver (such as a yellow exclamation mark).\nRight-click the mouse under Mice and other pointing devices and select Update driver.\nFor macOS, ensure that macOS is up to date, as it might contain drivers for external devices.\n4. Check for Zoom-Specific Issues\nTest Zoom without the mouse: Try using Zoom with keyboard shortcuts (such as Ctrl + Alt + Shift + H for hiding the meeting controls) to see if the mouse disconnection still occurs.\nZoom settings: Go to Settings in Zoom and check if there are any settings that could be interfering with your mouse, such as hardware acceleration (which might conflict with certain graphics or input devices).\nTry using Zoom’s web version: See if the problem persists in the web browser version of Zoom.\n5. Check for System Updates\nEnsure that both your operating system and Zoom application are up to date. Sometimes, issues like this are resolved with updates or patches.\nFor Windows: Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update.\nFor macOS: Go to Apple Menu > System Preferences > Software Update.\nFor Zoom: Open the Zoom app, click on your profile picture, and select Check for Updates.\n6. Disable Power Saving Settings\nIn Windows, Power Settings might disable USB devices to save power, which can cause intermittent disconnections.\nGo to Control Panel > Power Options, and choose High performance or customize the power plan to prevent USB ports from being turned off.\nCheck in Device Manager (under Universal Serial Bus controllers) and ensure USB Root Hub has the option \"Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power\" unchecked.\n7. Disable Conflicting Software\nDisable or uninstall any third-party software that might interfere with your mouse, such as mouse management tools, screen recording software, or virtual desktop software.\nSome software like Zoom, Teams, or other video conferencing tools could conflict with each other, causing input devices to malfunction.\n8. Test in Safe Mode (Windows) or Safe Boot (Mac)\nWindows: Boot into Safe Mode to rule out any third-party software conflicts. Restart your PC and press F8 (or Shift + F8) to access Safe Mode.\nmacOS: Start in Safe Boot mode by holding the Shift key while restarting your Mac.\n9. Try a Different Mouse\nIf possible, test with a different mouse to see if the issue persists. This will help you determine if the problem is hardware-related or if it’s specific to your original mouse.\n10. Reinstall Zoom\nSometimes a corrupted installation of Zoom can cause peripheral issues. Try uninstalling and then reinstalling Zoom.\nOn Windows, go to Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program.\nOn macOS, drag the Zoom app to the trash and reinstall from the official website.\n11. Check for Background Processes\nSome background processes or applications (such as antivirus software) can interfere with your mouse. Try closing unnecessary programs or disabling your antivirus temporarily to check if the issue is resolved.\n12. Consider Hardware Issues\nIf the issue continues even after trying all the steps, the mouse itself or the USB port may be faulty. Test a different mouse or consider replacing the mouse.\nLet us know if this helps or if you need further assistance.\nLike\nReply\nGetting Started\nCommunity Getting Started Guide\nCommunity Guidelines\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nLogin to the community\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nEnter your E-mail address.

After signing in the cursor flashes and we are unable to type anything to schedule a meeting. Have tried getting all Windows updates up to date, reinstalling and trying both the 32 and 64 bit versions of the client, cleared cache and cookies....\nLooking at the processes after signing in, it looks like MS Edge WebView 2 is running under it which looks like it may be the problem. Is there a resolution to this?\nLike\nReply\nFollow\nA\nacompton\nEmployee\nForum|Forum|4 years ago\nAugust 19, 2021\nDo you have a separate sign-in window and/or Windows Notification box in your taskbar?  Sometimes Windows will pop-up a window to allow firewall access, administrator rights, etc. but it doesn't pop on top of other windows.\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nB\nBF_Zoom\nAuthor\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|4 years ago\nAugust 19, 2021\nThere is no additional pop up or Windows notification.  I also tried disabling out Anti Virus and software Firewall as well as running the desktop app as an administrator.  Issue still persists.\nThanks\nLike\nReply\nJ\njdubk1978\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|4 years ago\nAugust 19, 2021\nWe've been having the same issue and there's been no consistency. Some of our people have the issue, some don't. Windows 7/10, doesn't matter. We use roaming profiles and installing the full installer:\nhttps://www.zoom.us/client/latest/ZoomInstallerFull.msi\nThis solution worked about about version 5.7.4.\nLike\nReply\nB\nBF_Zoom\nAuthor\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|4 years ago\nAugust 19, 2021\nI think I may have figured this out. The application seems to work as it should by running it in compatibility mode for Windows 8. Right click the shortcut -> properties -> compatibility tab -> Change settings for all users -> Check Run this program in compatibility mode.\nThanks\nLike\nReply\nA\nAxel5\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nApril 21, 2024\nI have this\nissue about the microsoft edge web view2\nLike\nReply\nT\nTheShadowAngel\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nMay 28, 2024\nI upgraded from Zoom 5.17 to 6 and got multiple freezes (scheduling appointments, viewing appointments), but now I am able to work in the new version Zoom Workplace thanks to this trickery:\nClose Zoom Client and rename:\nC:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Zoom\\bin\\\nzWebview2Agent.exe\n, for example to\nzWebview2Agent_Backup.exe\nLaunch Zoom Client and work as before, but if you upgrade to a newer version, you will need to repeat the procedure (if freeze).\nLike\nReply\nGetting Started\nCommunity Getting Started Guide\nCommunity Guidelines\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nLogin to the community\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nEnter your E-mail address.

It works fine on the built-in camera app and Teams. In Zoom, it shows a black screen. The frustrating thing is, I've tried every troubleshooting step I've seen listed. The computer is a Gateway GWTN156-7 running Windows 11 standard.\nSteps I've tried:\nRepairing the Zoom installation\nUninstalling and re-installing Zoom and restarting\nEnsuring that desktop apps (including Zoom) have permission to use the camera\nUpdating the camera driver in device manager (no update available, no rollback available)\nUninstalling the camera in device manager and restarting\nUninstalling the USB hub in device manager and restarting (camera shows up as 'usb camera'\nRemoving the camera from the Windows \"Bluetooth and devices\" menu and restarting\nUpdating Windows and restarting (all updates now current)\nChecking that the camera switch isn't turned off (it's not, again, other apps work)\nLooking for a driver for the camera on the Gateway support site (no camera drivers listed)\nChanging capture methods to either direct capture or media foundation and restarting Zoom\nDisabling hardware acceleration in Zoom\nRunning the Windows video troubleshooter\nI'm at my wit's end here. I've tried everything I can think of.

Every time Zoom opens, it crashes within a matter of seconds. I don't even have time to join a meeting or sign in; it simply crashes. I can't even check the Zoom settings. Anything I try to do, Zoom crashes. I get \"Zoom quit unexpectedly\" and I can send the report to Zoom, however it never gives me any indication why it crashed. The only thing I can do where it won't crash is check for updates.\nI've uninstalled Zoom (a number of times) using the CleanZoom utility, rebooted, installed the latest version (5.8.3) of Zoom again (ensuring it was the x64 version), and it still crashes. I've even attempted to install a previous Zoom version (5.8.1) and it still crashes. I've applied any and all Win 10 updates.\nI have Zoom installed on other laptops and they work fine.\nAny suggestions? Any way to find out why it crashes, like seeing a report?\nLike\nM\n1 person likes this\nReply\nFollow\nBest answer by\nkader\nHello, i had the same problem and i deactivated the PowerToys Video Conference which acted as my camera driver.\nH\nHappy_To_Help\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|4 years ago\nNovember 11, 2021\nI guess its either you installed the wrong\nversion for your desktop or may be it's a storage problem.\nIs your desktop updated to the latest update ? And your desktop is using which windows ?\n2 replies\nLike\nReply\nM\nmariom\nAuthor\nNewcomer\nForum|Forum|4 years ago\nNovember 11, 2021\nI have the latest version of Zoom installed, downloaded from their website.

To fix Zoom crashing and avoid other potential program issues, you should always update your device drivers to the latest version. And here are two safe ways for you:\nManual driver update\n– You can update your device drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.\nAutomatic driver update (recommended)\n– If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with\nDriver Easy\n.\nDriver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making mistakes when installing.\nYou can update your drivers automatically with either the\n7 days free trial\nor the\nPro version\nof Driver Easy.

If the driver update doesn’t give you luck, continue to Fix 4.\nFix 4 – Disable PowerToys Video Conference\nMicrosoft PowerToys is a set of Windows system utilities that includes a Video Conference Mute feature. If you have this tool installed, it creates a virtual camera driver on your system which can conflict with Zoom’s camera access mechanism. As a result, users may experience frequent Zoom crashes during meetings. According to the Zoom community forum, disabling the PowerToys Video Conference feature has successfully resolved these crashes for many users\n1\n.\nFirst, check if PowerToys is installed:\nOn your keyboard, press the\nWindows logo key\n+\nR\nto open Run command window. Then type\nappwiz.cpl\nand press\nEnter\n.\nIn the list of installed programs, check if the\nPowerToys\nprogram exists.\nIf PowerToys is installed, note that simply closing PowerToys won’t fix the issue. Instead, follow these steps:\nIf PowerToys is running on your PC, please exit the program.\nOn your keyboard, type\npowertoys\n, then right-click on\nPowerToys\nand click\nRun as administrator\n.\nOnce PowerToys reopens, double click “Input/Output” in the left sidebar and click\nVideo Conference Mute\n. Then turn\noff\nthe\nEnable Video Conference Mute\ntoggle\nRestart Zoom.\nCheck if your Zoom app works properly without crashing.\nIf this fix doesn’t resolve your Zoom crashing issue, please move on to the next fix, below for further troubleshooting.\nFix 5 – Check the camera privacy settings\nIf the Zoom app is not allowed to access your camera, it won’t work properly. Follow the steps to fix the issue.\nOn Windows 11:\nOn your keyboard, press the\nWindows\nkey and the\nI\nkey together. Select\nPrivacy & security\n, and then\nCamera\non the right side.\nMake sure the\nCamera access\nis\nOn\n, and also make sure that\nLet apps access your camera\noption is also\nOn\nfor Zoom.\nOn Windows 10:\nOn your keyboard, press the\nWindows logo key\n+\nI\nat the same time to open the Settings menu.

Then check if your Zoom stops crashing. If not, please proceed to the next fix.\nFix 6 – Run Zoom on the dedicated graphics card\nThe built-in integrated graphics card on your PC is usually not powerful to manage demanding apps and games and can cause them to crash. If you’re using two GPUs, make sure to run Zoom on the dedicated one. Below we’ll show you how to do this on the NVIDIA control panel.\nAMD users can follow this\nguide\nto configure switchable graphics in Radeon settings.\nRight-click any empty space on your desktop and click\nNVIDIA Control Panel\n.\nSelect\nManage 3D settings\nfrom the left pane.\nClick\nProgram Settings\nand click the\nAdd\nbutton below.\nSelect\nZoom Meetings\nfrom the list and click\nAdd Selected Program\n.\nUnder Select the preferred graphics processor for this program, choose\nHigh-performance NVIDIA processor\n.\nClick\nApply\nat the bottom right corner to save the changes.\nCheck if Zoom still crashes a lot.

Then, type\nappwiz.cpl\nand click\nOK\n.\nRight-click\nZoom\nand click\nUninstall\n.\nGo to\nZoom’s official website\nand download the latest client.\nNow you should find the newly-installed app functioning without issues.\nIf you’re using Zoom on browsers, you should\nclose other unnecessary tabs\nto avoid the Zoom crashing issue. Or you can simply\nswitch to another browser\nthat make the Zoom meeting work.\n1:\nZoom Community\n. (2021, November 10).\nZoom crashes on startup\n[Online forum post].

Fortunately, troubleshooting Zoom issues doesn’t always have to be difficult. You can actually fix quite a few of its problems yourself. To help get your\nZoom\ncalls working properly, we’ve collected the most common Zoom problems users face and have provided easy solutions to be able to fix them.\nIf you also use m or are making the switch to Zoom because of issues with Teams, check out our guide to fixing\nMicrosoft Teams problems\n; maybe you will find a solution there so you won’t have to make the switch.\nWebcam or audio not working\nZoom\nNothing is more frustrating than having your webcam or audio not work on a Zoom call. If your web camera is not showing up or is selected but not working, try some of these\nbasic tips\nfirst.\nSolution 1: Check Zoom settings\nOn the pop-up that prompts for a meeting ID just before joining a call, leave the following settings unchecked:\nDon’t connect to audio\nTurn off my video\nThis allows you to join a call with your audio and video automatically enabled.\nSolution 2: Exit other related apps\nIf your webcam isn’t showing up, make sure all other programs that use the webcam are closed. Zoom may not be able to use the camera if it’s currently being accessed by a different application.\nSolution 3: Test the audio and video\nIf your webcam or audio issues persist, you can test your audio and video in Zoom by\nclicking this link\n. Once open, you can join a test call on the Zoom application and follow the instructions on the screen.\nSolution 4: Check PC settings\nSometimes, the problem might not be Zoom at all. If you’re on a\nWindows 10 or Windows 11\nPC or Mac, the webcam might be blocked. You can correct this by checking your app permissions to make sure the Zoom app or your web browser can use your webcam.\nOn the web specifically, you can also check this setting by restarting your call and making sure you press\nAllow\nwhen prompted about the camera and mic access.\nWindows 10\nEnter “webcam” in the taskbar search box and select C\nhoose which Microsoft apps can access your c\namera\nfrom the menu. Scroll down, and you’ll see the list of Microsoft Store and desktop applications that are allowed to use your webcam.\nFor non-Microsoft Store apps, like Zoom, you’ll need to make sure the toggle for\nAllow desktop apps to access your camera\nis switched to the\nOn\nposition\n.\nThere are also similar settings you can adjust in the Windows 10\nMicrophone\nsettings.\nWindows 11\nIn Windows 11, type\nWebcam\nin the Start Menu and select the\nCamera privacy settings\nlink. From there, find the\nLet apps access your camera\noption, and make sure that the toggle switch is\nOn\n. Then select this option to expand it so you can find the\nLet desktop apps access your camera\noption. Then make sure that toggle switch is also\nOn\n.\nmacOS\nOpen\nSystem settings\nand select\nPrivacy & security.\nYou can then select\nCamera\nand make sure your desired web browser and\nZoom\nare toggled on. You can also follow similar steps to adjust your microphone access settings. Just select\nMicrophone\ninstead of\nCamera\n.\nNote:\nSome laptops also have a physical webcam switch that must be enabled to allow the webcam to function properly. Double-check that yours is in the right position if you have one.\nSolution 5: Reinstall Zoom\nIf all else fails, uninstall the software. The next time you try to join or start a virtual meeting, the web browser client should download the software for you. You also can\nmanually install the software from Zoom\n.\nEchoes during a call\nZoom\nAnother common problem with Zoom is an audio echo during a meeting. If you hear an audio echo or feedback, there are three possible reasons why.\nSolution 1: Limit the input\nSomeone could have both computer and telephone audio active at the same time. In this case, ask them to either hang up on the telephone call or exit the PC-based audio during the conference by selecting the\nUp arrow\nicon next to the microphone icon and choosing\nLeave computer audio.\nSolution 2: Move or disable external speakers\nComputer or telephone speakers might be too close to each other. Ask the two people that are too close to each other to move apart or shut a door. You could also ask one of them to leave the audio conference or mute audio on their device; though muting by itself may not always be as effective in reducing the echo. Using headphones helps reduce the echoing effect, too.\nSolution 3: Disable additional audio\nMultiple computers with active audio could be in the same conference room. Again, ask the two people that are too close to each other to move apart or close a door. You can also ask one of them to leave the audio conference, mute audio on their device, or wear headphones.\nZoom lags or freezes during meetings\nMicrosoft/Unsplash\nLagging and freezing usually indicate a problem with your internet connection. Here’s what to do about choppy video quality:\nSolution 1: Change the connection\nOn a mobile device, move to an area with a better connection to see if this helps. On PCs, stick with a wired Ethernet connection, if possible. Otherwise, get close to the local router and use the 5GHz connection — it’s faster and (typically) less congested. If you need an upgrade, here’s our guide to the\nbest wireless routers\nyou can get.\nSolution 2: Check the connection speed\nAim for the right internet speeds for a successful video chat. When talking with multiple people in a team setting, you want the upload speed around 1Mbps and the download speed around 600Kbps. You can always check your current speeds with a\nquick internet speed test\n. If the speeds are undesirable, repeat Solution 1. Also, you can check out our tips on\nhow to increase internet speed.\nSolution 3: adjust Zoom settings\nTry unchecking the\nHD\nand\nTouch up my appearance\noptions. To access these options, click your\nProfile\nicon on the main screen of the Zoom desktop app and choose\nSettings\nfrom the menu that pops up, or select the\nArrow icon\nwithin the video camera icon during a call and then select\nVideo settings\non the pop-up menu. After that, select the\nVideo\ncategory listed on the left (if it isn’t already selected).\nBy unchecking these two options, you will decrease the amount of bandwidth your video connection requires (and the overhead on your system’s hardware), which can help fix problems with lag.\nI can’t share my screen\nZoom\nSharing your screen is an important part of many Zoom calls. It’s as easy as clicking\nShare screen\nat the bottom of the Zoom window. If you’re planning to share your screen during a call, check a couple of settings first.\nSolution 1: Check your connection\nSharing your screen takes up a lot of bandwidth. Make sure that you have a solid internet connection and that you’re connected to the call. Use a wired connection, if available, for the best performance.\nSolution 2: Try a Share Screen meeting\nOn the home screen, select the\nDown arrow\nicon next to\nNew meeting\nand uncheck\nStart with video\n. Your meeting will then start with only audio, freeing up bandwidth. Your video will not be automatically turned on.\nAlternatively, if you’re already on a call and need to share your screen, turn off your video by selecting the\nStop video\nbutton and then select the green\nShare screen\nbutton.\nI have no remote control while screen sharing\nZoom\nWhen sharing your screen, the viewer can request remote control to help you troubleshoot or explain a process more clearly. This tool is listed as\nRequest remote control\nunder\nView options\nand can be accessed at any time while sharing the screen. If you want to enable remote control, but it’s not working properly, there are several possible issues to consider.\nSolution 1: Allow remote control\nChances are, the sharer (host) is not agreeing to the request for remote control. A notification will pop up on their screen, and they must choose\nAllow\nto enable remote control.\nSolution 2: Don’t interfere with the host PC\nThe sharer (host) may be interrupting the process. Technically, the person sharing their screen can stop the remote control at any time by clicking their mouse. Always leave the host computer alone while the viewer (client) assumes remote control.\nSolution 3: Find a compatible device\nYou could be on the wrong device. iPad and Android devices, for example, cannot give or request remote control, but someone else can give them control.\nI am not getting email messages from Zoom\nN/A\nAnother common problem is not being able to receive email messages from Zoom. This can include notifications and activation emails. These can take up to 30 minutes to arrive and may take longer. If it doesn’t arrive, you need to make sure that your email is configured properly.\nUsually, this isn’t something on your end, so you’ll need to ask your IT department to\nwhitelist Zoom’s email IP addresses\n. If you’re using Gmail or a personal email service, check your spam folder too. Emails will come from\nno-reply@zoom.us\n.\nZoom is crashing\nDigital Trends\nIf Zoom is crashing and closing itself entirely, see if these solutions help.\nSolution 1: Check for service issues\nCheck\nZoom Service Status\nand\nDowndetector\nto see if there is a regional Zoom problem. Sometimes there are server issues or platform maintenance, which could mean the service will be down for a while. You will need to wait, if this is the case.\nSolution 2: Use the web version\nTry the web version if the problem isn’t regional. As long as your internet connection is sufficient, it tends to be a bit more reliable if the installed app is experiencing problems.\nSolution 3: Check Zoom settings\nSometimes Zoom can get confused about audio versus video settings. If it’s trying to use your webcam connection as an audio output, for example, it will often start crashing as a result. Make sure video connections are routed to your webcam and, if necessary, your audio is routed to connected speakers.\nI am getting Zoom-bombed\nPeace N Peas / Zoom\nYes, Zoom bombing is a thing. It’s a growing fad of joining a private meeting and disrupting it with anything from blaring music to porn —\neven courtrooms aren’t immune\n. If someone Zoom-bombed your meeting in the past, there is one solution that is incredibly effective at preventing future invasions.\nSolution: Require a passcode!\nThe host creating the meeting and sending out invitations can require all participants to enter a passcode before joining. That means strangers have a hard time finding ways to drop in. In fact, requiring a password is set as the default.\nAnd if you are worried about hacking in more elaborate ways, there is good news: Zoom has end-to-end encryption to\nall\nmeetings. For more information about enabling this feature,\nread Zoom’s guide\n.\nUltimately, this will help protect content and prevent more advanced versions of Zoom-bombing, even if you are using a free account.\nMy Zoom meeting won’t record\nZoom\nDo you not have the option to record your Zoom meeting? It’s probably an issue with your permissions. Here’s what to do.\nSolution 1: Manage Zoom permissions\nOnly hosts can record Zoom meetings, or pass that ability on to someone else. If you’re supposed to be the recorder in your meeting, ask your host to give you permission with the\nParticipants\nmenu, where the\nMore\nbutton will show an option to\nAllow record\n.\nSolution 2: Use built-in screen recorders\nThis is somewhat clunky, but both Windows and macOS have built-in screen recorders you can turn on to capture the portion of the screen where your Zoom meeting is taking place.\nI’m too worried about Zoom security to use it for my business\nZoom\nThat’s understandable, as Zoom has had several security flaws in the past, including a notorious bug that\nallowed hackers to take control of Mac computers\n. That gave many business users pause, although you don’t have to give Zoom up if you rely on it.\nSolution: Update consistently\nZoom has been pretty good at pushing fast patches for its bugs, especially security fixes to keep Zoom safe. The company also provides detailed information\nabout its latest releases\nto review. If Zoom is always updated, it’s certainly safer to use.\nNote that Zoom business plans also include managed domains which may help to limit Zoom use to only authorized users.\nIf you want to consider something other than Zoom, check out our guide to the\nbest Zoom alternatives\n.\nFrequently asked questions\nHow do I know if Zoom is down?\nIf you’re wondering if the service is down, there are two ways to check. You can either check the\nZoom Service Status webpage\nto see if Zoom’s various services are operational. Or you can use a third-party website like\nDowndetector\nto see if other users have reported issues or outages.\nHow do you know if Zoom is up to date?\nYou can check if your Zoom desktop app is up to date by using the apps Check for Updates feature. To do so: Open the Zoom desktop app and select your\nProfile\nicon. Then choose\nCheck for updates\nfrom the menu that appears. Zoom will then automatically scan for and install any updates the app may need. If there aren’t any new updates, Zoom will simply say that your app is up to date.\nHow do I check my Zoom settings?\nYou can view and adjust your Zoom settings on the desktop app by doing the following:\nOpen the Zoom desktop app and select your\nProfile\nicon. From the menu that appears, choose\nSettings\n. In the Settings menu, you’ll be presented with a variety of settings and options you can select and adjust.

I hope you are doing great.\nI'll try to brief as short as possible, a TL;DR if you will / bug report form.\nWhat happens:\nLatest zoom version on Windows is unresponsive, and the only solution is to close the app and rejoin the meeting.\nWhen does it happen:\nWhen trying to double click for full screen (doesn't happen when maximising the window), or when trying to restore the meeting by clicking the picture-in-picture window.\nWhere does it happen:\nWindows 11 Home, 23H2, OS Build 22631.4317, Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.22700.1041.0.\nOperating system and zoom application are up to date, Windows Insider Programme is disabled.\nI hardly think another application is conflicting and causing this to happen.\nHow to reproduce:\nEnter a meeting, switch to full screen mode, program freezes.\nEnter a meeting, go to another window so that PIP is active, program freezes.\nOnly solution is to close and rejoin the meeting.\nWhat I have tried:\nThe most I did, because it was time to format my computer, is to reinstall the OS with an official debloating method from Microsoft (so that shouldn't be the issue either). It's called answer files and you can read more about it here ->\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/update-windows-settings-and-scripts-create-your-own-answer-file-sxs?view=windows-11\n. As an example, I've based my own 'unattend.xml' on the ones found here ->\nhttps://github.com/memstechtips/UnattendedWinstall?tab=readme-ov-file\n.\nWhat I have not:\nGoing into windows recovery mode (I don't remember the proper name right now) with network enabled to see if the program would open there and crash or not. Maybe I'll do it if I have spare time and post an update here. I don't know if it is related to the meeting being recorded or not, but I have no way of knowing that and I think that's a job for Zoom developers and testers in my humble opinion.\nAdded context and final questions:\nI'm an IT professional, and I've tried common things like keeping both the app and my system updated, and I even sent through the OS the crash report to the app if I remember correctly. My computer has more than enough resources to run it, so it's probably not hardware related.\nDoes it happen to anyone else? If so, have you find a permanent solution besides waiting for zoom to fix it?\nThank you very much and have an awesome day!\nIván Weinberg\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/iweinberg/\nVideo\nRecordings\nOther\nLike\nReply\nFollow\nGetting Started\nCommunity Getting Started Guide\nCommunity Guidelines\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nLogin to the community\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nEnter your E-mail address.

You might have clicked it inadvertently.  If you find it\nalways\ncomes on without your action, you need to provide us with more details about your setup, what occurred before this happened, etc., so we can help figure out why this happens. At this point, we don’t have enough info.\nLike\nJ\n1 person likes this\nReply\nShow 1 more reply\nJ\nJepZoomie\nEmployee\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nMay 2, 2022\n@Ray_Harwood\nThanks,\n@teddy7\nSorry if I haven't got your concern correctly. if you can try replicating the issue, it would be best if you can send some screenshots as well or kindly provide more detailed information.\nLike\nReply\nGetting Started\nCommunity Getting Started Guide\nCommunity Guidelines\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nLogin to the community\nLogin with SSO\nLogin with Saml2\nLogin with Token\nEnter your E-mail address.

Our platform tracks every\nreported outage, performance issue, and maintenance window to ensure\nyou're informed. Whether Zoom is experiencing a problem now or\nhas recently resolved one, our detailed history keeps you updated.\nMore than 3,300\nStatusGator users monitor Zoom\nto get notified when it's down, is under maintenance,\nor has an outage.\nThis makes it\none of the most popular Education services\nmonitored on our platform.\nWe've sent more than 506,600 notifications to our users\nabout Zoom incidents, providing transparency and peace of mind.\nYou can get alerts by\nsigning up\nfor a free StatusGator account.\nEarly Warning Signals\nIf we detect a potential Zoom outage or other issue\nbefore it was reported on the official status page\nwe will send an Early Warning Signal notification to StatusGator subscribers.\nWe can often detect issues before they are officially acknowledged by the\nprovider, giving you a head start on resolving any potential problems.\nDown Notifications\nIf Zoom is having system outages or experiencing other\ncritical issues, red\ndown\nnotifications appear on the status page.  In\nmost cases, it means that core functions are not working properly, or\nthere is some other serious customer-impacting event underway.\nWarning Notifications\nWarn\nnotifications are used when Zoom is undergoing a\nnon-critical issue like minor service issues, performance degradation,\nnon-core bugs, capacity issues, or problems affecting a small number of\nusers.\nMaintenance Notifications\nZoom posts separate notifications for planned maintenance\nwork. StatusGator will notify subscribers when Zoom enters a\npre-planned maintenance window, keeping you up to date.\nStatus Messages\nWhen Zoom posts issues on their status page, we collect the\nmain headline message and include that brief information or overview in\nnotifications to StatusGator subscribers.\nStatus Details\nWhen Zoom has outages or other service-impacting events on\ntheir status page, we pull down the detailed informational updates and\ninclude them in notifications. These messages often include the current\ndetails about how the problem is being mitigated, or when the next update\nwill occur.\nComponent Status Filtering\nBecause Zoom has several components, each with their\nindividual statuses, StatusGator can differentiate the status of each\ncomponent in our notifications to you whenever a particular component is down. This means, you can\nfilter your status page notifications\nbased on the services, regions, or components you utilize.\nThis is an essential feature for complex services with many components\nor services spread out across many regions.\nGet notified about Zoom outages\nStay updated with instant alerts for Zoom outages by signing up now!\nStart monitoring for free\nLooking for Downdetector Zoom alerts?\nFeatures\nStatusGator\nDowndetector\nBoth official and crowdsourced updates for Zoom outages.\ncheck icon\nx icon\nMore than 5,040 services monitored.\ncheck icon\nx icon\nProactive alerts on Zoom status changes sent to your Slack, Microsoft Teams, and more.\ncheck icon\nx icon\nMonitoring of both Zoom and your own apps.\ncheck icon\nx icon\nGranular monitoring of Zoom components.\ncheck icon\nx icon\nBoth official and crowdsourced updates for Zoom outages.\nStatusGator\ncheck icon\nDowndetector\nx icon\nMore than 5,040 services monitored.\nStatusGator\ncheck icon\nDowndetector\nx icon\nProactive alerts on Zoom status changes sent to your Slack, Microsoft Teams, and more.\nStatusGator\ncheck icon\nDowndetector\nx icon\nMonitoring of both Zoom and your own apps.\nStatusGator\ncheck icon\nDowndetector\nx icon\nGranular monitoring of Zoom components.\nStatusGator\ncheck icon\nDowndetector\nx icon\nFrequently asked questions\nCan't find your question?\nEmail us\nto arrange a time to discuss.
