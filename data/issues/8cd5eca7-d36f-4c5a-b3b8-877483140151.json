Cloud)\nThis page documents known issues and limitations in Git Integration for Jira Cloud along with available workarounds.\nOn this page:\nRepository limits per integration\n2GB object size limit\nSmart commits user search issue\nMicrosoft pull request status updates\nMicrosoft PAT organization permission\nSSH repository automation triggers\nTag loading timeout\nLeft sidebar loading delay\nDuplicate Smart Commit commands\nWeb links not updating\nRepository Limits Per Integration\nGit Integration for Jira Cloud limits the number of connected repositories per integration:\nGit Service\nMaximum Repositories\nGitHub\n10,000\nGitLab\n10,000\nAll others\n10,000\nReference: GITCL-1395, GITCL-1846\n2GB Object Size Limit\nGit Integration for Jira uses the JGit library, which does not support objects over 2GB in size stored in git repositories.\nWorkaround:\nRemove large objects from repository history or use Git LFS for large files.\nSmart Commits User Search Issue\nSome users have smart commits attributed to the app user rather than specific users when user search via email fails.\nWorkaround:\nUse the assignable users API endpoint:\n/rest/api/2/user/assignable/search?issueKey=ABC-123\nReference: GITCL-800\nMicrosoft Pull Request Status Updates\nMicrosoft integrations require all pull requests for configured repositories to be requested each time for status updates. Microsoft’s Pull Request APIs do not provide filtering by last changed date/time.\nReference: GIT-3889\nMicrosoft PAT Organization Permission\nIMPORTANT\nWhen creating personal access tokens (PAT) for Microsoft/Azure integrations, select\nAll accessible organizations\n. Otherwise, the integration will not work.\nSee\nCreating Personal Access Tokens\nfor instructions.\nFor more information, see the\nofficial Azure DevOps PAT documentation\n.\nReference: GIT-3978\nSSH Repository Automation Triggers\nAutomation for Jira triggers work with auto-connected integrations and single HTTPS authenticated git repositories, but single repositories authenticated via SSH are not supported by Atlassian Jira Cloud.\nSee Atlassian bug:\nJSWCLOUD-20935\nWorkaround:\nUse HTTP/HTTPS connections for single repository git URLs:\nConnection Type\nExample\nTrigger Support\nSSH (not supported)\n[email protected]\n:admin/repo.git\n❌\nHTTPS (supported)\nhttps://github.com/admin/repo.git\n✅\nReference: GITCL-1624\nTag Loading Timeout\nLoading tags on integrations with large git history can take a long time. Git Integration for Jira Cloud limits tag loading to\n10 seconds\nbefore timing out.\nLeft Sidebar Loading Delay\nThe Git Integration for Jira app panel in the left sidebar takes up to 10 seconds to load.\nAtlassian has opened a\nbug ticket\nfor this issue.\nDuplicate Smart Commit Commands\nWhen both Atlassian and GitKraken Smart Commit processors are enabled, users see duplicate\n#comment\nand\n#time\ncommands.\nProcessor\nCommands Supported\nAtlassian\n#comment\n,\n#time\n,\n#<transition>\n+ workflow triggers\nGitKraken\n#comment\n,\n#time\n,\n#<transition>\n,\n#assign\n,\n#label\nRecommendation:\nUse Atlassian processor (default) for workflow trigger support. Use GitKraken processor only if you need\n#assign\nand\n#label\ncommands.\nReference: GITCL-1334\nWeb Links Not Updating\nIn rare cases, web links for branches and tags do not update automatically after modifying the web-linking template.\nWorkaround:\nTemporarily disable the affected Plain Git integration.\nRe-enable the integration to apply the web linking update.\nReference: GITCL-3981\nLast updated: December 2025\nHave feedback about this article?

2022, 10:10am\n1\nHi, I am trying to create a Jira App and used the getting started with connect tutorial.\nI followed all the steps in the tutorial and my app successfully installed on my development server. But when I want to open the app it is continually loading and crashing after around 30 seconds.\nMy code is copied out of the tutorial and I changed baseUrl to my ngrok Url.\nI also used changed authtoken for ngrok as it was said in the tutorial.\nHow can I fix this?\nThank you for any help\nCaterinaCurti\nJuly 20, 2022, 12:25am\n2\nHi\n@anon91417509\nand welcome to our developer community here!\nIs there anything that you can find in the browser developer console that can help here? Maybe the request timed out and that can be seen in the network tab or maybe there is a Javascript error? Do you see the request being received in the console that you are using where the app is running?\nIf there are no errors, is there anything shown in the response? What does “crash” mean?\nAlso, if you are new to developing using Atlassian in Cloud, you could check out the Forge tutorial instead of the connect one:\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/build-a-hello-world-app-in-jira\n.\nLet us know,\nCaterina\n1 Like\nanon91417509\nJuly 20, 2022,  7:37am\n3\nHey,\nthanks for the fast reply.\nIt gives out this error for 3 different sources:\nSource map error: Error: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.\nAnd after that it shows:\nAdd-on iframe timed out for add-on  com.example.myapp\nI don’t think it can be an error in the code because the code is the same as in the tutorial.\nJohannes\nCaterinaCurti\nJuly 21, 2022,  1:29am\n4\nJohannes,\nAre you sure that the\nngrok\ntunnel is still running? What happens if you try to open the app URL directly in a browser by going to the ngrok URL, which has been set as\nbaseUrl\ndirectly. Does that open in the browser?\nThat would be\n<baseUrl>/helloworld.html\n.\nYou should also see a log request in the\nhttp-server -p 8000\nconsole like this (when opening the URL directly from the browser, there will be additional parameters like\nxdm_e\n,\nxdm_c\netc. when opening it from the Jira site.\n[2022-07-21T01:22:08.582Z]  \"GET /helloworld.html\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.111 Safari/537.36\"\nAlso to make sure, is\nthis\nthe tutorial that you are using or is it a different one?\nCaterina\n1 Like\nanon91417509\nJuly 21, 2022,  7:58am\n5\nHello ccurti,\nyes the ngrok tunnel was still running and I am also able to see the content of my file when I click on the baseUrl\nI can also see the log request and everything works fine as it is written in the tutorial.\nYes this is the tutorial I was using. All steps work fine (also loading the app onto jira without any errors) only the last step, opening the app doesn’t work.\nJohannes\nCaterinaCurti\nJuly 21, 2022, 10:35pm\n6\nMmmhhh… could it be that the ngrok tunnel has been restarted and the baseUrl was not updated on the site?\nAfter the baseUrl is updated in the atlassian-connect.json file, the app needs to be installed again by following\nthese steps\nfrom the tutorial.\nAny change to the Connect descriptor file require to re-install the app to become available.\nIf that’s the case, you should be able to see a\n404\nin the Network tab of the developer tools with a request being sent to an ngrok URL which is not the one defined in the baseUrl.\nIt would look like this:\nimage\n2706×1050 425 KB\nCaterina\n1 Like\nBen2\nFebruary 15, 2024,  3:02pm\n7\nI can confirm i get the same response. ngrok is running, the forwarding tunnel address is correct and if I navigate to that address in my browser I am able to get both my json file and html file (the names in the .json file all match the respective file names).\nUpdate: I found the cause but I don’t know how to get around it. Digging through the network requests I found that the request to ngrok is returning the “You are about to visit . This website is served for free through\nngrok.com\n. You should only visit this website if you trust whoever sent you this link”. If I navigate to that url i only get it when I clear my cache or visit for the first time in a new browser. Not sure how to bypass this in jira\nFor anyone that finds this.

It's created by a team with 10 years of Jira Excel reporting experience, and it ships with a template for every use case.\nTypical Jira Cloud for Excel errors\n1. Jira Cloud for Excel stopped working\nIf you had been using Jira Cloud for Excel before, and it suddenly stopped working, then it's most probably a passing glitch.\nYou can try the usual suspects of:\nRestart Excel\nDisable-enable the add-in\nDisconnect-reconnect to Jira Cloud\nBefore that, check the latest questions and discussions on Atlassian Community.\nMaybe someone posted about it and alerted Atlassian.\nIf you are in luck, Atlassian is already working on a fix.\nJira Cloud users who experienced that Jira Cloud for Excel is not working, often say that it \"fixed itself\" after a few days.\nSo if you can afford to wait, give it a couple of days.\nJira Cloud for Excel has all kinds of cryptic errors that come and go. 🤷\nIf you can't wait, try a dedicated solution, like\nBetter Excel Exporter\nnow.\n2. Jira Cloud for Excel is not working\nWhen Jira Cloud for Excel fails to return issues, it shows this error message:\n\"Hmmm ... looks like we stumbled a bit, please try again or contact Atlassian support if the issue persists.\"\nA quick fix that can work is updating the Filters.\nChange the JQL query that is currently in use or otherwise enforce Excel to update the Jira issues in your spreadsheet.\nA failed authentication to Jira Cloud can also cause this.\nIf updating your JQL query didn't help, disconnect Jira Cloud for Excel or Google Spreadsheets and re-connect.\n3. Jira Cloud for Excel loading gets stuck\nSometimes the loading indicator spinner gets stuck in Jira Cloud for Excel.\nThe add-in just shows a spinner and the operation times out.\nThe process may complete eventually but then it shows the JQL query again.\nIn this case\nclearing the cache manually\nand logging out and back into Jira can help.\n4. Error in connection \"No valid plugin Found...\"\nThis error message comes when you successfully install the Jira Cloud for Excel add-in on a desktop Excel version, but it doesn't launch.\nInstead, you get the\n\"Error in connection \"No valid plugin Found...\"\nor the\n\"We can't load this add-in because we couldn't connect to the catalog\"\nmessage.\nJira Cloud for Excel installed on an incompatible Excel version\nThis is most probably caused by the fact that Jira Cloud for Excel is an Excel add-in and only works with certain Excel versions.\nJira Cloud for Excel is tied to Microsoft's cloud infrastructure, so this downside will always be there.\nYou can read more in our blog on this and other\nfacts about Jira Cloud for Excel\n.\nIf your Excel version is not compatible with Jira Cloud for Excel, update your Microsoft Office suite or Excel to a newer version.\nAlternatively, look for a solution that is better integrated into Jira Cloud.\n5. Jira Cloud for Excel updates are very slow\nThis glitch slows you when you are trying to import your Jira issues into an Excel spreadsheet.\nIt's not a blocking error.\nThe import eventually succeeds, but it's painfully slow.\nFirst, look at how many issues you are trying to import.\nIf it's a lot (in the high thousands), then try importing a smaller set of issues.\nAdjust your JQL query or modify the filter you are using.\nCollecting Jira issue data and compiling an Excel file can be a resource intensive task in itself.\nFor Jira Cloud for Excel is even harder, as it's one step farther from the data source.\nIt needs to jump extra hoops, a native Jira Cloud app wouldn't need to.\nIf changing the set of Jira issues is not possible, disable and re-enable the add-in or restart Excel.\nThis is what many experienced Jira Cloud users recommend, however there is no evidence that it fixes this type of error.\nThere is also a chance that you are affected by a\nknown bug\nthat causes performance degradation in Jira Cloud for Excel.\nThe previously mentioned reason is true here as well.\nJira Cloud for Excel is integrated into Microsoft Excel and not Jira Cloud.\nThe risk of connection failure between systems will always be there.\nThis is not the case if you use a Jira Cloud app.\nSolve all above errors at once\nIf your team relies on complex Excel reports, you are most certainly better off with a professional Jira Cloud Excel reporting app.\nEven if you export from Jira Cloud to Excel occasionally, an unreliable tool is not a good investment.\nBetter Excel Exporter for Jira Cloud is an enterprise-ready Excel reporting app for Jira Cloud.\nIt's prepared for the typical uses cases with built-in Excel report templates.\nBuilt-in Excel report and export options in Better Excel Exporter Cloud\nDoes it suffer from the same errors?\nBetter Excel Exporter is a native Jira Cloud app.\nYour Excel report generation is not dependent on Microsoft or any other third-party.\nThe app sits inside Jira Cloud, eliminating compatibility and connection problems.\nYour\nreports are compatible with any Excel version\non any operating system, on desktop or in the cloud.\nBetter Excel Exporter is about to be migrated to Forge, the future cloud platform of Atlassian apps.\nDon't take risks!\nBuild your Jira Cloud Excel reporting workflow on a future-proof, scalable solution with a technical support team at your service.\nWant to try?

If you are running a Server product, you can visit the\nAtlassian Server end of support\nannouncement to review your migration options.\n*Except Fisheye and Crucible\nSummary\nCheck what to do when your Jira Cloud Migration Assistant (JCMA) preflight checks fail with \"Jira Software is not available on your cloud site\".\nOverview\nA Jira migration gets blocked due to one of the following errors in JCMA:\nJira Software is not available on your cloud site.\nJira Work Management is not available on your cloud site.\nJira Service Management is not available on your cloud site.\nNone of the Jira projects being migrated belong to the Jira product mentioned in the error message (e.g., only Jira Work Management projects are being migrated, but the error message states that Jira Software is not available on the destination cloud site).\nCause\nPossible root causes:\nSome scoped groups have access to the Jira product that is missing on the destination cloud site.\nA project was created as a Jira Software project and then converted into a Jira Work Management project afterward.\nThe internal table\nlicenserolesgroup\nstores the links between the groups and the Atlassian products they can access.\nThe following SQL statements can be executed on the source Jira Server/Data Center instance to check if any of the scoped groups have access to the Jira product that is missing on the destination cloud site:\nJira Work Management missing\nSELECT * FROM licenserolesgroup WHERE license_role_name = 'jira-core';\nJira Service Management Missing\nSELECT * FROM licenserolesgroup WHERE license_role_name = 'jira-service';\nJira software missing\nSELECT * FROM licenserolesgroup WHERE license_role_name = 'jira-software';\nExample of output\nIf scoped groups have access to Jira products that are missing on the destination cloud site, then the affected groups must be adjusted accordingly.\nSolution\nPossible solutions:\nInstall the missing Jira product on the destination cloud site.\nRevoke the access to the missing Jira product from the affected groups on the source Jira Server/Data Center instance.\nDelete the incorrect group role permission (entry from the table\nlicenserolesgroup\n) from the source Jira Server/Data Center instance.\nUpdated on\nSeptember 25, 2025\nWas this helpful?\nYes\nNo\nIt wasn't accurate\nIt wasn't clear\nIt wasn't

This change applies to customers who have the original user management experience.\nFrom March 27, 2025, you’ll no longer be able to assign this role to a user. Existing trusted users will still be able to access products and product administration. They won’t be able to invite users or add a product to a site.\nTrusted users currently belong to a group that’s hidden from\nGroups\n. This group assigns trusted users their user and product admin roles. When we remove the trusted user role, we’ll unhide this group so you can continue to manage its users as a group. It will appear in\nGroups\nas\ntrusted-users-<site ID>\n.\nWe’re making this change to bring customers who have the original user management experience closer to the centralized user management experience. You can\nread more about this in our Community post\n.\nWe recommend you inform your trusted users of this change. To find the trusted users for a site, go to\nadmin.atlassian.com\n>\nProducts\n. Navigate to the site, then select “Trusted” in the “Any role” filter.\nIf you need to give a user the ability to invite new users or add products to a site, make them a site or organization admin.\nHow to assign admin roles\nCopy specific Jira Service Management and Jira Work Management projects to your sandbox\nROLLING OUT\nCopy only the projects you need to save time setting up your Jira Service Management and Jira Work Management sandbox.\nUnderstand how to select data to copy\nTo copy specific Jira Service Management and Jira Work Management projects from your production to its sandbox:\nGo to\nadmin.atlassian.com\n.

After this rule takes effect, users will no longer find a download button in sections like the attachment list, macros, and file previews.\nWe opted to extend the data export rule rather than introduce a new one because of the considerable overlap between export and download. Our findings showed that the types organizations needing to block exports also wanted to prevent attachment downloads.\nThis change will affect any existing policies that have configured the data export rule to block exports.\nThe data export rule requires Atlassian Guard Standard.\nTo check whether your data security policies currently block exports:\nGo to\nadmin.atlassian.com\n.

You can now view work items grouped by\nStatus\n,\nAssignee\n,\nPriority\n,\nSprint\n,\nStory Point\n,\nStory Point Estimate\n, and\nCategory\n.\nTo group work items in the\nAll work\ntab:\nMake sure you are in the list view in\nAll work\n.\nSelect the\nGroup\nbutton.\nChoose one field that you’d like to group your list by.\nYour list will then be grouped by your selection and will only be visible to you.\nBeta: Link similar work items using Atlassian Intelligence\nROLLING OUT\nThis Atlassian Intelligence (AI) feature is in beta.\nRead more about Atlassian Intelligence features\nUse AI to surface and link work items that are similar to yours. Linking similar work items that have been worked on in the past can help you understand the complexity of planning and be a great resource for referring to prior art when coding.\nTo find and link similar work items using AI:\nOpen your work item.\nSelect\nImprove work item\nin the issue details section.\nSelect\nLink similar work items\n.\nSelect\nLink\nnext to each work item to link them one by one, or select\nLink all\nto link all at once.\nThe work items are linked with a ‘relates to’ link type.\nMap data to Jira issue types to organize your project better\nROLLING OUT\nIn the\nnew import experience\n, we're adding a capability for administrators to set up[ issue types|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/what-are-issue-types/] and hierarchies. This can help you categorize and organize your team’s work by either assigning Jira issue types (epic, task, story, bug, and/or subtask) or creating custom issue types before importing.\nWhen importing data, map column headers from your CSV file to\nissue type\n,\nissue ID\n, and\nparent\nfields. In the next screen (\nMap values to issue types\n), you can map the values within the selected issue type column to Jira issue types or create custom issue types.\nMore about mapping data to Jira issue types\nRename your managed teams in Atlassian\nROLLING OUT\nBack in March 2025, we released\nManaged Teams\nfor Premium and Enterprise customers. This allowed organization admins to sync an Atlassian team to a group to better control team information and membership, but this change meant the team name would change to match the synced group. Now, organization admins can change a managed team's name from the team profile and while staying synced to the group.\nTo change a managed team's name:\nGo to the managed team's profile.\nSelect the team's name, or select the\nTeam settings\nbutton.\nEnter the new name you want to use in the\nTeam name\nfield.\nAutomatically clone an issue when it’s done\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now set an issue to automatically clone once its status has been updated to anything defined as “Done” in your project’s status categories. No need to create the same issue over and over for the tasks you regularly need!\nClone issues will automatically inherit all the same fields as the issues they were cloned from - except for attachments, start dates, due dates, links, and child issues. They’ll even inherit the “Clone when issue is done” automation rule, so you can keep the fun going.\nRead more about automatically cloning issues\nTo clone an issue automatically:\nOpen a Jira issue and select\nActions\n.\nSelect the toggle next to\nClone when issue is done\nto switch the automation on or off.\nPrevent people from downloading attached files\nROLLING OUT\nData security policies\nallow you to use rules to control how users, apps, and people outside the organization interact with content in Confluence and Jira.\nWe’re extending the\ndata export rule\nto also block the downloading of files attached to Confluence and Jira. After this rule takes effect, users will no longer find a download button in sections like the attachment list, macros, and file previews.\nWe opted to extend the data export rule rather than introduce a new one because of the considerable overlap between export and download. We found that organizations that needed to block exports also wanted to prevent attachment downloads.\nThis change will affect any existing policies that have configured the data export rule to block exports.\nThe data export rule requires Atlassian Guard Standard.\nTo check whether your data security policy currently block exports:\nGo to\nAtlassian Administration\n. Select your organization if you have more than one.\nSelect\nSecurity\n>\nData security policies\n.\nSelect a policy, and check whether exporting data is blocked.\nSummary view now available in software projects\nCOMING SOON\nProject summaries are now available across all Jira Cloud software projects!

To view a project summary, navigate to your project, and then select\nSummary\n.\nRead more about the summary view\nManage work types when creating issues in team-managed projects\nROLLING OUT\nTo help keep your work types updated as your needs change, we’ve added the ability to manage work types when creating issues in team-managed software and business projects.\nWhen creating an issue from the top navigation bar, admins can now create and edit work types, or navigate to the work type settings page for more options.\nYou must be a project admin to be able to add and edit work types when creating issues.\nTo\ncreate work types\nwhen creating issues:\nGo to your team-managed project.\nSelect\nCreate\n, then\nWork type\n.\nSelect\nCreate work type\n.\nAdd a\nname\n,\ndescription\nand\nicon\nfor the new work type, and select\nSubmit\n.\nTo\nedit work types\nwhen creating new issues:\nGo to your team-managed project.\nSelect\nCreate\n, then\nWork type\n.\nSelect\nEdit work type\n.\nUpdate the\nname\nand/or\ndescription\nof the work type, and select\nSubmit\n.\nTo\nmanage work types\nwhen creating new issues:\nGo to your team-managed project.\nSelect\nCreate\n, then\nWork type\n.\nSelect\nManage\n.\nYou will be redirected to the work type settings page.\nThe 'External Assets Platform' Custom Field is shutting down\nROLLING OUT\nThe ‘External Assets Platform’ is shutting down as part of our ongoing efforts to deliver the most streamlined and integrated service management solution.\nLearn more about the shutdown of the 'External Assets Platform'.\nIf you’re a customer currently using the ‘External Assets Platform’ to add context to your Jira issues, we recommend you consider adopting Assets in Jira Service Management, available to Premium and Enterprise customers. Assets allows you to use the Assets objects custom field to display your objects on Jira tickets, and gives you the ability to display your Assets data within Confluence, along with many other features.\nJira: Grant permissions to manage versions (releases) in one project only\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now assign a dedicated\nManage Versions\npermission in Jira and Jira Service Management projects without giving full project admin access. Users with this permission can create, release, archive, merge, edit or delete versions within a specific project only. This applies to company-managed projects in Jira and Jira Service Management, and team-managed projects in Jira only.\nJira automatically grants this permission to users with project admin permissions.\nTo grant the\nManage versions (releases)\npermission in a company-managed project:\nGo to a project’s settings then select\nPermissions.\nUsing the\nActions\nmenu, select\nEdit permissions.\nUnder Project permissions, look for\nManage versions (releases)\n. Add the roles, groups, or people you’d like.\nSelect\nUpdate\nto save your changes.\nTo grant the\nManage versions (releases)\npermission in a team-managed project:\nfor tea,-managed projects, select\nAccess\nthen\nManage roles\n.\nSelect\nCreate role\n, then find\nManage\nproject name\nversions (releases)\n.\nAdd the roles, groups, or people you’d like.\nSelect\nUpdate\nto save your changes.\nIntroducing a brand way to delete multiple issues in the issue navigator\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re introducing an easier way for users to delete multiple issues from their projects.\nTo delete multiple issues from the issue navigator:\nSelect multiple issues from the list view in the issue navigator.

Select\nDelete\nto delete the selected issues.\nThe end is near for Epic Link and Parent Link fields\nCOMING SOON\nFor a little over a year, we've been working to combine the\nEpic Link\nand\nParent link\nfields in company-managed projects into the new universal\nParent\nfield (\nwhich you can read about here\n). To prevent data loss, the values from both fields have been automatically ported into the\nParent\nfield.\nWith this change, the values in the\nEpic Link\nand\nParent link\nfields are no longer visible on the Issue view. If your issue view still includes these fields, simply swap it for the\nParent\nfield instead.\nRead more in our documentation\nIt just got easier to keep on top of your unread comments\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re introducing an unread badge in the\nComments\ncolumn in the list view to help you easily identify work items with unread comments. This allows you to stay on top of important discussion and collaborate with your team.\nTo make sure you get to try this feature, we’ll be automatically adding the Comments column to all list views.\nJoin the conversation and give us early feedback\nCreate unique, customizable pages in your help centers\nROLLING OUT\nJira Service Management Premium and Enterprise users can create and design landing pages in their help centers.\nAdmins can use landing pages to curate and efficiently organize help resources for specific subjects or audiences in a visually appealing manner.

Previously when filling out a form, customers would only be able to see the object name which made it hard to know what option to select. Now you’ll see the same attributes listed alongside each object - just like you do on request types.\nAdd and remove fields from field configurations; new tools to optimize fields in your projects\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re introducing a number of improvements to the way field configurations and field configuration schemes work. In addition, we’re also adding some new tools which make it easier to remove unused work types and fields from schemes. Here are more details about what’s changing.\nYou can now remove and add fields to field configurations\nRemoving a field from a field configuration is similar to hiding it. However, when a field is removed, its configuration isn’t preserved. It will need to be entered again if the field is re-associated.\nAdding a field to a field configuration is similar to unhiding it. Once unhidden, it becomes available to the projects associated with the field configuration scheme.\nYou can manage field associations in the Jira admin panel or using the new\nfield association REST API\n.\nWe’re releasing tools which allow you to optimize fields\nThese tools will automatically identify and remove unused work types from a scheme, as well as unused fields from a field configuration scheme and field configuration. For more details about these tools, see this\nAtlassian community announcement\nor type: entry-hyperlink id: 5m0df9oFEgswh305bKEQ1v\nUnlocking another level of help center customization\nROLLING OUT\nThe Jira Service Management help center is getting a sleek and modern design update across all its pages, offering new opportunities for customization.

Select\nCustomize\n, then\nEdit page layout\nfrom the navigation.\n3. Select the section you want to customize and manage its settings on the side panel.\nValidate additional fields input in Atlassian Automation\nROLLING OUT\nWe're introducing a new feature that allows you to validate additional fields input in Atlassian Automation rules, including JSON syntax. This feature will help you to find possible warnings and errors that may impact your rule, so you can fix them before it runs. It'll be available across components that allow you to provide additional fields input, including the Create issue, Clone issue, Edit issue, Transition issue and Create incident actions.\nYou can also validate input containing smart values that are wrapped in double curly brackets, such as\nassignee.displayName\n. This feature has limited capacity to validate input that contains smart values without these brackets. We currently don't support validating input that\nonly\ncontains smart values (which may occur if you try to enter your JSON through smart values alone) or smart values sections.\nTo get started with this feature:\nOpen the Automation rulebuilder.\nSelect a trigger for your rule, plus an action that supports additional fields, like\nCreate issue\n.\nEnter your desired input into the Additional fields section.\nOpen the dropdown menu next to\nTurn on rule\n.\nSelect\nValidate rule\n.\nAny errors or warnings found in your rule, including the additional fields, will be displayed.\nFix any errors or warnings before turning on your rule. Warnings don't need to be fixed before the rule is enabled, but we recommend resolving them as soon as possible, to ensure your rule will run as planned.\nSelect\nTurn on rule\n.\nYour rule is now ready to use.\nLearn more about additional fields in Atlassian Automation\nPublic access is now available for Jira forms\nROLLING OUT\nWe are adding a\nPublic\naccess option to the forms available in Jira business and software projects. Any user, including those without a Jira license, will be able to submit a response through a public form.\nOnly people with project admin permissions will be able to create a public form, and these will be available for all licence editions and both team-managed and company-managed projects. In addition, Jira admins will be able to disable public forms on their site. There is one setting for team-managed projects and one for company-managed.\nAn unlicensed user can submit a response through a public form, but they will need a Jira license to view and collaborate on the work item created from their submission.\nWe've launched a new prioritization project template\nROLLING OUT\nWhen you set up a new project in Jira, you can use project templates. There are many to choose from, including specific templates from different apps like Jira Product Discovery and Jira Service Management.\nWe've just added a new template for projects that are all about gathering ideas and prioritizing them. With this new prioritization template you can list ideas and add data to them. You can then use this data with common frameworks (such as RICE) to prioritize. The project has multiple views, like an effort and impact matrix, list, or roadmap view, so you can see and share your priorities in a way that suits you.\nAnyone who has Jira Product Discovery and permission to create projects can use this template.\nSee the Premium features in-product before starting a trial\nROLLING OUT\nWe're introducing a new and faster way to understand and upgrade to Jira Service Management Premium trial. Whenever you choose to upgrade to Premium or start a trial, you will see a modal which lists all new features available to you.\nNow you can create roadmaps from your Jira timeline\nROLLING OUT\nSometimes, you need a custom roadmap view to share your work plans with certain stakeholders. You may not need to include specific dates, for example. Now, you can access Jira Product Discovery from the Jira timeline view. Look for a button that says \"Create roadmap\" when you select the \"Share\", \" Today,\" or \"Timeline mode\" buttons.\nYou can use Jira Product Discovery to create custom roadmaps, then share them with anyone, even if they don't use Jira.\nOnly people who are admins and don't already have Jira Product Discovery will see this change. You dismiss it anytime.\nPlans in Jira - More Program boards per plan!\nROLLING OUT\nIn Plans, you can now have up to ten active Program boards at one time in a plan. A Program board is considered 'active' if it has an end date in the future.\nPreviously, you could only have two.\nProject delete improvements\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re making the project deletion process easier to follow. When a project is moved to trash and marked for deletion, you have a 60 day window in which to restore a project. After that, the project will be permanently deleted.\nWith this change, if you don’t require the 60 day grace period, you can select '\nDelete now\n' from the project trash list menu. A ‘\nDeleting now\n’ message confirms the project deletion process is underway.\nJira: Reparent work items in list view\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now select (drag and drop) work items to reparent them. This makes it easier to restructure work without losing your place.\nTo reparent a work item:\nMake sure you're in the list view within your project\nSelect (using drag and drop) the work item you want to reparent.\nMove it to the new location (drop it). This will update the hierarchy.\nWe're making it easier to compare plans during a trial\nROLLING OUT\nWhen you're in a trial, you can now click on the trial button in the top navigation and see the plan options available to you. This way, it'll be easier for you to understand the plan that is best for your team based on the features that plan includes. You can also easily upgrade and pay from the plans page.\nAvoid accidentally deleting work items\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re changing the way Premium and Enterprise users delete work items to help avoid accidental deletions. When you attempt to delete a work item, you can now choose to archive it, or confirm that you want to delete it.\nCreate and manage email templates for stakeholder notifications\nROLLING OUT\nJira Service Management Premium and Enterprise users can now save time and customize stakeholder notifications on the go with email templates.\nEmail templates provide an easy and efficient way to customize stakeholder notifications. They eliminate the need to draft new emails from scratch, especially when teams are responding to incidents, allowing for quick customization and notification. Templates ensure consistent messaging by structuring emails to include all necessary information. You can also use predefined placeholders and dynamic fields, which help minimize the likelihood of omitting critical details.\nTo create an email template:\nGo to\nSettings\n, then\nProducts.\nUnder\nJira Service Management\n, select\nIncident management\n.\nGo to\nEmail templates\n.\nSelect\nCreate template\n.\nType in name, sender and reply address, upload header image, if any, and type in the email body.\nSelect\nSave template\n.\nFind out more about creating and managing email templates\n.\nA cleaner All activity tab in work items\nROLLING OUT\nWe’ve updated the All tab in the activity section of each work item. This improves readability and reduces clutter.\nIt's easier to scan and understand updates in a work item’s history, at a glance:\nEntry grouping\n: Similar updates are now grouped together to reduce clutter.\nModern UI\n: Improved alignment, formatting, and date presentation for a cleaner look.\nProgressive disclosure\n: Long descriptions and details are now collapsible, reducing excessive scrolling.\nThis more structured and intuitive layout helps you quickly access relevant updates without the overwhelming detail.\nJira Plans - Turn releases off and on in your plan\nROLLING OUT\nReleases are a powerful tool for planning work for software teams, but for Marketing or Design teams? Not so much. For planners who don't need to see releases information from their plans, you can now hide it for a simpler planning experience.\nWhen you turn releases off in your plan, you’ll no longer see:\nthe\nReleases\ntab\nthe\nReleases\nfield from the timeline as well as any filters that use it\nrelease markers on the timeline, calendar, and program board\nthe option to group work items by assigned releases in the View settings menu\nany rolled up dates based on releases\nFor a full breakdown of this new feature,\nread more in our documentation\n.\nJira: Create work items in a group in list view\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now create work items directly within a group in the list view. This feature automatically adds the group field (such as assignee) to the new work item, streamlining your workflow.\nTo create a work item in a group:\nGo to the list view in your project.\nSelect the group where you want to create the work item.\nSelect\nCreate\nto add a new work item, which will automatically include the group field.\nJira: Improvements to the child work item panel\nROLLING OUT\nThe child work item panel is faster to load and more responsive.\nYou now get smoother scrolling, better performance and real-time, instant updates (without needing to refresh).\nJira: Introducing an improvement to attachment previews\nROLLING OUT\nIntroducing\nGrid view\nfor attachments.\nThis change improves the organization and visualization of attachments.\nAttachments appear in a grid view rather than the strip view and list view. You'll still be able to switch to another view, and save that as the default if you prefer.\nGrid view helps you to more easily navigate through your content.\nCustomize project backgrounds with images and color gradients\nROLLING OUT\nJira admins can add different colors and images to project backgrounds.\nTo change the background, you must be a Jira project admin using the\nnew navigation\n.\nTo set a theme in a\ncompany-managed project\n:\nNext to your project's name in the sidebar, select\nMore actions\n(\n•••\n)\n.\nSelect\nSet project background\n.\nSelect a theme.\nTo set a theme in a\nteam-managed project\n, you can follow the above steps, or:\nSelect\nMore actions\n(\n•••\n) next to the project name.\nSelect\nSet project background\n.\nSelect a theme.\nLimits to work type schemes and field configurations are coming in 2026\nCOMING SOON\nWe recently announced that Jira will limit the number of work types that can be used in a project to improve performance and reliability of large sites starting in\nFebruary 2026\n. Work type schemes will be capped at\n150 work types\nper scheme\n, and field configurations will be capped at\n700 fields\n.\nIn our recent post in the Atlassian Community, we cover what tools are available to help you clean up your sites in preparation for this change.\nSubscribe to your change calendar and explore the new filters\nROLLING OUT\nWe’ve made major improvements to the change calendar to help you stay on top of change events and avoid conflicts across your services, Assets objects, and teams.\nSubscribe to change calendar from your external calendar\nYou can now generate an iCal link and subscribe to your change calendar from apps like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Outlook. This lets you stay updated on change activity without logging into Jira Service Management.\nNew JQL filtering in change calendar\nUse JQL to filter work items shown in the calendar view. Filter by affected services, affected Assets objects, change types, or any custom fields, so you can focus on exactly what matters.\nShow or hide change events by type\nChoose which types of change events to display on the calendar, including freeze windows, maintenance windows, and standard work items.\nLink your change calendar with affected services and Assets objects\nYou can now select affected services and Assets object fields when creating a new change window.

This feature enhances the presentation of numerical data and provides an easy way to track information like budgets, estimates, costs, and more.\nYou must be an admin to edit fields.\nTo try out a number field with currency or percentage formatting:\nStart in a team-managed project.\nNext to your project's name in the sidebar, select\nMore actions\n(\n•••\n), then\nProject settings\n.\nSelect\nFields\n.\nFind the number field you’d like to configure, select\nActions\n(\n•••\n), then\nEdit field.\nIn the\nFormat\nsection, select either\nCurrency\nor\nPercentage\n.\nIf you selected\nCurrency\nas the format, you can then select a\nCurrency\ntype (for example, USD or AUD).\nImprove visual and hierarchy of the Quick actions menu in the work item\nROLLING OUT\nWe’ve improved the Quick actions menu in the work item with a cohesive visual look, and better action hierarchy and grouping, making it easier for you to find and use the tools you need.\nWe’ve also added Goals and recommendations to the menu.\nOpen a work item and select the Add button under the summary.\nAdd a assignee when creating work items on a timeline\nROLLING OUT\nUsing the timeline in software projects, you can now add a assignee straightaway when creating a work item.\nTo create a work item with an assignee:\nSelect\n+ Create Epic\n, or hover over a parent work item and select\nCreate a child work item (\n)\n.\nGive the work item a name.\nChoose a work type from the dropdown (if your project has more than one work type).\nSelect the assignee icon and choose an assignee.\nPress enter or return on your keyboard to create your work item.\nFix broken links after migrating from one cloud site to another\nROLLING OUT\nWhen migrating Jira Cloud or Confluence Cloud to a different site, some links between individual entities may break due to changes in the URL. This typically includes:\nLinks to Jira work items that users have pasted as URLs in comments and descriptions.\nLinks from other instances to the migrated site, such as links from Confluence pages to your Jira work items.\nPreviously, the only way to resolve broken links was to contact Atlassian Support, which wasn’t ideal for those who prefer to do it in their own time.\nTo address this, we’ve included cloud-to-cloud migrations in\nLink fixing\navailable at\nadmin.atlassian.com\n. You can now update all broken links in bulk, including local links within your migrated instance and remote links from other instances.\nLearn more about fixing links after migration\nTo get started with link fixing:\nGo to\nadmin.atlassian.com\n, and select your organization.\nGo to\nSettings > Link fixing\n.\nReview the list of instances that were migrated and start updating links on each of them.\nWe're making it easier to find Confluence in Jira\nROLLING OUT\nIf you've been given access to Confluence, you'll see a spotlight highlighting how you can navigate to the in-Jira version of Confluence, called Project Pages. This way, you'll be able to find and create documentation right in Jira.\nJira: Create work items inline in the Backlog with AI (beta)\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now use AI to generate multiple work items directly inline in the Backlog, based on content from a Confluence link.\nAI analyzes the linked Confluence page and suggests relevant work items for you to review and create—all without switching context. It supports cross-site linking and respects your existing access permissions to Confluence content.\nAI-powered work creation helps you save time, reduce manual effort, and streamline backlog management by quickly turning documentation into actionable tasks.\nTo get started:\nGo to the\nBacklog\nin your Jira project.\nIn the inline create field, select\nGenerate from Confluence\n.\nSearch or paste a Confluence link, then select\nSuggest work items\n.\nReview the suggestions. Then, accept them individually or all at once to create work items.\nEnhanced automation filtering and search experience\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re making it easier and faster for you to find what you need in Atlassian Automation.\nStreamlined template filtering:\nYou can now effortlessly filter templates by app and trigger, allowing you to quickly narrow down your options and find the perfect template for your needs.\nFaster and more reliable search:\nOur enhanced search capability ensures that results are displayed more quickly and reliably, so you can spend less time searching and more time automating.\nTo find new template filters:\nOpen\nAutomation\nfrom your Atlassian app.\nSelect the\nTemplates\ntab.\nAttachments now supported for the 'Send customized email’ action in Automation\nROLLING OUT\nWe’ve introduced the ability to add attachments to emails sent as part of your automation rules.\nOnce a rule has been saved or enabled, you’ll be able to upload files as part of the email content. When the rule executes, any uploaded files will be included as attachments to the emails that are sent.\nThis capability will be available when using the\nSend customized email\naction as part of your Jira automation rules, and will become available for use in other Atlassian apps in the future.\nRead more about the\nSend customized email\n[ action in Automation.|https://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/jira-automation-actions/#Send-customized-email]\nThis highly-requested update includes:\nAttachment support:\nYou can now add up to 10 attachments (in most file formats with a total size of 4MB) to your automated emails.\nSecure storage:\nAll attachments are stored securely in Atlassian’s media platform, ensuring reliability and compliance.\nEasy preview:\nOnce uploaded, you can open a preview of an attachment by selecting a card in the\nAttachments\nfield.\nTo add attachments to your automated emails:\nAdd the\nSend customized email\naction to an automation rule, then fill in the email details in the\nSettings\ntab.\nSelect the\nContent\ntab, then from the\nAttachments\nfield browse or drop the files you want to attach to the email.\nSelect\nUpdate\n.\nNote that the rule must be saved or enabled before you can add attachments to the email action.\nMore functionality in the new workflow editor, plus it's becoming the default experience\nROLLING OUT\nThis release has two small improvements which means the New workflow editor can do everything that the old workflow editor could do. These changes are:\nYou can set a name for your transitions when you create them, and rename existing transitions.\nWhen you change the name of a status that's included in a transition, the transition automatically updates to match the new name.\nAnd with those changes, the New Workflow Editor is a worthy successor to the old one, and we're excited for it to become the new face of workflow changes in Jira.\nThat said, Jira will use the new workflow editor by default when editing global workflows unless you've set the old editor as your default in settings. If you set the old as your default workflow editing experience, then nothing will change for you, but we are planning to deprecate it soon.\nFor now, enjoy the vastly superior new workflow editor. Let us know what you think by sending us feedback through Jira.\nAvoid accidentally deleting work items\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re changing the way users delete work items to help avoid accidental deletions. When you attempt to delete a work item, you must complete a two-step process to confirm the action.\nTo delete a work item:\nSelect the work item you want to delete.\nSelect\nMore actions\n(\n•••\n), then select\nDelete\n.\nTo go ahead with deleting the work item, type “delete” in the text box.\nSelect\nDelete\n(this option will only be available after you type “delete” in the text box).\nWe're deleting unused field associations\nROLLING OUT\nStarting today (June 16, 2025), we’re beginning the process of removing unused field associations from your field configuration schemes. We expect this process to take several weeks from today. Once finished, this will improve the performance and stability of your Jira instances.\nIf this causes any issues in your projects, we have documented the steps for adding fields back in this\nAtlassian community announcement\n. The page also covers how we determine which associations to delete. If you have any questions about this scheduled deletion, you can ask them in the comments section of the linked announcement.\nSelecting dates in Jira is now easier\nROLLING OUT\nWe’ve made improvements to the way you select dates and times in Jira, making it more efficient to schedule work and keep your team on track.\nKey changes:\nSmart defaults:\nThe placeholder date has been updated to the current day’s date and time.\nKeyboard navigation support:\nYou can now press \"tab\" or \"enter\" to confirm a selection.\nAdd web links to the top of your team profile\nROLLING OUT\nWe've consolidated all your team's important links to the \"Team links\" section at the top of the profile. Now, you'll see connected Jira, Confluence, and Loom spaces alongside any links to external tools or important pages.\nTo add links to your profile:\nGo to the team's profile page.\nFind the \"Team links\" section at the top, and select the + button.\nPaste in the link and change the display text if you want it to say something different.\nAllow Slack apps to trigger on-call alias responses\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now allow Slack apps, workflows, or webhooks to trigger Jira Service Management ChatOps responses using schedule aliases.\nPreviously, ChatOps only responded to alias messages sent by users. Now, when an app posts a message with an alias, you can allowlist it directly from the message shortcut menu. Once allowlisted, ChatOps will respond just like it does for user messages, making it easier to integrate bots, monitoring tools, and workflows into your on-call process.\nTo allow an app:\nHover over the alias message sent by the app, select the\nMore actions\nmenu >\nMore message shortcuts\n>\nAllowlist app\nNavigation: App shortcuts migrated to platform component\nROLLING OUT\nApp shortcuts in the sidebar now use a shared platform component, replacing previously product-specific implementations. There is no change to the user experience, but this update aims to streamline navigation across Atlassian products, improve app discoverability, and support future customization.\nProactive child work item suggestions powered by AI\nROLLING OUT\nGet context-aware child work item suggestions proactively generated by AI.\nThis feature recommends relevant child work items based on the details of the parent work item, helping you save time, reduce manual effort, and stay organized. When you accept a suggestion, a new child work item is created and linked to the parent work item.\nYou can also hide the proactive suggestions and manually use AI to generate child work items when it suits you.\nRead more about AI features\nTo get proactive, AI-powered child work item suggestions:\nOpen a work item.\nSelect\n+ Add\n, then select\nSubtask\n. You’ll see a list of suggestions for child work items in the Subtasks section.\nIn the\nCreate suggested child work items\npanel, select\nShow results\nto expand the results.\nSelect\nCreate\nto add individual work items, or\nCreate all\nto add them all simultaneously.\nReconfigure automation rules with Create feature flag in LaunchDarkly Action by June 30, 2025\nCOMING SOON\nWe are deprecating the “Create feature flag in LaunchDarkly” action in Atlassian Automation on June 30, 2025. As a result, the rules linked to LaunchDarkly and this action will cease to function as intended after this date. To prevent rule failures, all rules employing this action must be reconfigured on or\nbefore June 30\n, 2025. Please note that the reconfiguration can only be completed successfully if you have an account with LaunchDarkly.\nMore about the\ndeprecation of the LaunchDarkly Action in Atlassian Automation\n.\nTo determine if your rules are affected by this update and reconfigure them:\nSelect\nAutomation\nfrom project/global settings where you’re an administrator.\nSelect the\nAction\nfilter, then select the\nCreate feature flag in LaunchDarkly\nfrom the list of options\nOpen the rule and select the Action component of the rule\nSwitch to\nSend web request action\nto create a feature flag through\nLaunchDarkly's\npublic API\nThe Edit page action is now available in Jira Automation\nROLLING OUT\nWe've made the Edit page action available for use in Jira Automation. Previously, you could only use it in Confluence Automation.\nThe Edit Page action enables your rule to edit and add content to an existing page in Confluence. It can now be used alongside other actions, including those from Rovo AI agents.\nControl playbooks visibility using JQL\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now use JQL in the playbook details section to control playbook visibility. This helps agents see only the most relevant playbooks, improving process efficiency and reducing noise.\nRead more about playbook details\n.\nSuggestions of people to tag in comments\nROLLING OUT\nWhen adding a comment in a work item, you will now see suggested people to tag, making it easier to involve the right people in discussions.\nFormat numbers as currency or percentages in team-managed business projects\nROLLING OUT\nWe’ve added the currency symbol ($) and percentage symbol (%) to the number custom field to help you track budgets and spending.\nOnce set up, cards on your business board, fields on your forms, and work items directly, or in the\nAll work\ntab, will show numbers in the format set by your project admin.\nTo create a custom number field:\nIf you’re not already there, navigate to your team-managed business project.\nFor cards on your board: Select\nProject settings\n, then\nWork types\n. Select\nAdd work type\nfrom the sidebar, or edit an existing work type.\nFrom the\nAll work\ntab: Select\nAdd column\n(), then\nCreate another.\nFrom a work item: Select\nEdit fields\n(⚙️) in the details section.\nNavigate to the\nForms\ntab.\nChoose\nCreate a field,\nthen choose\nNumber\nas the field type.\nIn the\nFormat\ndropdown, select\nPercentage\nor\nCurrency\n.\nWe’re removing the default text renderer\nROLLING OUT\nTo improve consistency, reduce bugs, and provide a better editing experience across all of Jira Cloud, we’ll be removing the default text renderer.\nThis will:\nEnsure consistent formatting and rendering behavior.\nEliminate confusion and data loss due to mismatched renderers.\nProvide a unified editing experience across all Atlassian Cloud products.\nWhat’s changing:\nJira now only supports the wiki text renderer (which allows a user to enter wiki markup to produce HTML content).\nYou’ll no longer see the option to configure a default text renderer.\nAny fields currently using the default text renderer will be migrated automatically.\nEasier ways to view and edit your sprint commitments\nROLLING OUT\nThis change makes it easier for you to spot and adjust sprint commitments in your backlog.\nNow you can:\nQuickly understand if the sprint is over or undercommitted, with new icons and recommended improvements. The up arrow shows if the sprint is overcommitted, the down arrow shows it's undercommitted, and the tick indicates it’s just right!\nAutomatically view the related sprint in the insights panel by selecting the sprint commitment icon in the backlog.\nTurn the sprint commitment icons on or off, as you like, via your\nView settings\n(company-managed projects only).\nJira forms with public access now support attachments\nROLLING OUT\nAttachments are now supported in forms set to public access. This means that when someone submits a response to a public form, they can also upload an attachment, such as an image or video, to add more context. The attachment can then be viewed and accessed via the work item created from the form submission. There is a limit of 100MB per attachment.\nAdd a comment summary to improve your work item description\nROLLING OUT\nTo help make sure key decisions or details aren't lost over time, you can use AI to summarize the comments in a work item.\nSelect\nAdd to description\nto combine the summarized comments with an improved version of the existing description, or select\nCopy\nto add it manually.\nWe’re merging List and All work into one powerful view for all teams\nROLLING OUT\nJira now combines the\nList\nand\nAll work\nviews into one powerful, unified view for managing work items. It's simply called\nList\n. Learn more about the change in our\nCommunity announcement\n.\nTo use the new merged experience:\nOpen your project in Jira.\nGo to the main navigation and select the “List” tab (previously “List” or “All work”).\nExplore the combined features, including hierarchy, grouping, inline editing, and more — all in one place.\nJira: Conditional formatting now available in All Work\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now apply and edit conditional formatting rules directly within All Work, not just in the list view. This allows for consistent formatting and easier management of your work items.\nTo apply conditional formatting:\nGo to the\nAll Work\ntab in your project.\nSelect (…)\nMore actions\nthen\nFormat rules\n.\nEdit or apply rules as needed.\nYour organization-wide default data classification level now applies to Jira\nCOMING SOON\nData classification\nis the process of categorizing the sensitivity of information.\nPreviously, a default data classification level could only be applied to Confluence apps. We've now expanded this to include Jira, allowing you to set a default data classification level across both apps. This level will automatically apply to all unclassified content within these apps.\nIf you've already set a default data classification for your organization, it will now apply to all unclassified content in Jira, in addition to Confluence. If no organization-wide default classification level is set, content in Confluence and Jira will remain unclassified by default. However, you still have the option to set a default data classification level for\nspecific spaces and projects.\nData classification is a feature that requires\nAtlassian Guard Premium\n.\nTo apply a default data classification level across Confluence and Jira in your organization:\nGo to\nAtlassian Administration\n. Select your organization if you have more than one.\nSelect\nSecurity\n>\nData classification.\nSelect More actions (•••) >\nManage settings.\nChoose the classification level.\nSelect\nUpdate.\nHide empty sprints in the backlog\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now hide empty sprints from the backlog in software projects that use scrum. This helps you focus on sprints with active work and keeps your backlog organized.\nTo hide empty sprints in your backlog:\nSelect\nBacklog.\nSelect\nView settings.\nSelect the toggle next to\nEmpty sprints\nto hide sprints that don’t contain any work items.\nSelect the toggle again to show empty sprints.\nA more stable way to display media in Jira’s work item view editor\nROLLING OUT\nMedia in Jira’s work item view editor will now use pixel widths instead of relative sizing. This change helps prevent media from resizing unexpectedly while content loads, providing a more consistent experience.\nResize using the new handle:\nResize your images using the drag handle located on the sides of the images. Your image will proportionally grow or shrink based on how much you drag it in and out.\nResize using the new pixel entry:\nSelect the image, enter the size in pixels you want, and hit ‘return’. Simple!\nWhat happens to my previously inserted images?\nPages containing legacy images, which are not pixel entry or custom sizes, can be easily transformed to the new image resizing format by simply selecting the 'Convert to pixels' option while choosing the image. The images that require conversion will be indicated by a yellow dot located in their top-right corner.\nJira Service Management\nJira Service Desk is now Jira Service Management! We’re in the process of rolling out some exciting new features for all users.\nLearn more about these new features\n.\nA smarter way to control journey execution with parent conditions\nROLLING OUT\nNEW THIS WEEK\nYou can now add smart value conditions to journey parents, making it possible to run a journey only when a specific condition is met. This gives you more control over when your journeys are triggered.\nTo add a smart value condition to a Journey parent:\nGo to your journey type.\nOn your journey trigger, select the\nMore actions\n(•••) menu.\nSelect\nAdd condition\n.\nCustomize your condition according to your needs.\nPlans load faster to reduce initial load time\nROLLING OUT\nNEW THIS WEEK\nYou’ll now experience a faster loading experience in your Jira plans.\nPrevent the creation of change requests during freeze and maintenance windows\nCOMING SOON\nWe’re introducing a per-project option to prevent the creation of change requests that conflict with freeze and maintenance windows. Up until now, information about freeze and maintenance windows (which are used to show when changes should and shouldn’t be scheduled) has only been displayed in limited places, such as the change calendar and risk insights, which allowed conflicting change requests to be accidentally created. Now, you can prevent their creation.\nTo use this feature:\nGo to\nProject settings\nin the desired project.\nGo to\nChange management settings\n.\nNavigate to the new\nChange windows\ntab.\nEnable the option to prevent change creation during maintenance windows, or freeze windows, or both.\nThe system will check for change window conflicts during change request creation. The planned start, planned end, affected services, and assets fields will be used for conflict detection.\nManage alerts in the alert list\nROLLING OUT\nNEW THIS WEEK\nWe have updated the unified alert list to make it easier to see and manage all your alerts and alert groups in one place. This change brings a clearer layout and improved organization to help you quickly find and act on important alerts. We have improved minor bugs on the alert list as part of this release\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to draft a reply\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now use Atlassian Intelligence to draft replies (beta) for your customers.

Additionally, you can now easily add work items directly from the list.\nThis update improves clarity, structure, and scalability. It allows you and your teams to efficiently manage tasks in both team-managed and company-managed projects.\nPrefer a flat list view?\nIf you prefer working with a flat list of work items, you can easily customise your view.\nGo to\nView settings\nand select\nHierarchy\nAnnouncing a new way to streamline processes across your projects with Journeys\nBuild end-to-end journeys that automatically connect work items across both service and software projects in Jira Service Management. Here you’ll be able to get a view of all the work that needs to happen as part of a specific process, and the relationships between the specific teams doing the work.\nYou’ll also able to control when, where and how these work items get created so you can increase efficiencies by streamlining all the various processes that may cross multiple departments. This could include processes such as employee onboarding or off-boarding that require action from different teams who may not be in the same project.\nAll you have to do is set a trigger so a journey type knows when to start creating and linking work items across projects. You can also pause the progress of a journey by stopping subsequent work items from being created until a dependency on another work item’s status is met. Plus map Automation rules to specific work items in a journey that may require additional functionality or flexibility.\nRead more about journeys\nTo start using Journeys:\nFrom your company-managed service project, select\nProject settings\n, then\nFeatures\n.\nUnder\nFeatures lab\n, turn the toggle on next to\nJourneys\nto enable this feature.\nIf you participated in our early access program, this feature will be enabled for you by default.\nAutomation suggestions in issue and alert views\nROLLING OUT\nIn the issue and alert views, you’ll now receive automation rule suggestions to help improve your team’s efficiency and simplify the alert management workflow. These suggestions are generated based on keywords found in the issue summary and description, and offer relevant automation options that can be beneficial for your team. By implementing these rules, you can reduce manual tasks, save time, and ensure more consistent management of issues and alerts.\nIf you are an admin:\nTo set up and enable the rule for your team, click\nBuild this rule\n.\nTo modify an existing rule, click\nEdit in rule builder\n.\nBy default, automation suggestions are visible to everyone. To control who sees these suggestions, go to\nProject Settings > Features > Automation Suggestions\n. Turning it off will prevent your team from receiving suggestions.\nIf you’re an agent:\nYou can request your admin to build and enable the suggested rules for you.\nTo view details about a suggestion, click\nView rule\n.\nTo quickly send a request to your admin, click\nCopy message\nto copy the message and send it to your admin.\nEdit your help center's home page layout and add rich content to it\nROLLING OUT\nWith this release, admins will have more control over their help center's home page, allowing them to tailor it to fit the needs of their audiences. They will be able to:\nhide and reorder sections on the home page to create a more organized experience\nadd layouts, images, and rich content to make the help center visually engaging and user-friendly.\nThis will help admins create a more customized and appealing help center for their different audiences.\nDedicated page for Atlassian Intelligence answers in the virtual service agent\nROLLING OUT\nWe've moved the toggle for Atlassian Intelligence answers in the virtual service agent out of the\nSettings\npage and into its own\nAI answers\npage.\nTo turn Atlassian Intelligence answers on or off in your project's virtual service agent:\nFrom your service project, select\nProject settings\n, then\nChannels & self service\n, then\nVirtual service agent\n.\nSelect\nAI answers\n.\nTo activate Atlassian Intelligence answers, turn the toggle on next to\nAtlassian Intelligence answers\n, and then select\nActivate\n.\nAtlassian Intelligence answers will start working immediately in all of your connected channels.\nTo deactivate Atlassian Intelligence answers, turn the toggle off next to\nAtlassian Intelligence answers\n, and then select\nDeactivate\n.\nAtlassian Intelligence answers will stop working immediately in all of your channels.\nRead more about Atlassian Intelligence answers\n.\nIntroducing 'work' as the new collective term for items tracked in Jira Cloud\nROLLING OUT\nAs more teams make Jira their home for work, we’re committed to improving the language in our tools to better reflect the diverse ways you define and manage your work.\nWe’re introducing\nwork\nas the new collective term for all items tracked in Jira. We’re also exploring ways to incorporate the language you use for your own\nwork types\n.\n•\nRead more about these changes on the Atlassian Community\n.\nThis change builds upon our previous efforts to\nreduce the use of 'issue' terminology in Jira\n.\nAddress gaps in your knowledge base with suggested topics\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now quickly identify the topics that require knowledge base articles in your project with suggested topics powered by Atlassian Intelligence. This feature gives your team a headstart on knowledge articles you should be creating to deflect requests and increase self service among your customers.\nTo generate a list of topics, we analyze the details of recent requests in your project and check for related articles. The list of suggestions will be refreshed every 7 days, ensuring that your team remains informed of the most relevant topics.\nRead more about suggested topics in knowledge base\n.\nRename your managed teams in Atlassian\nROLLING OUT\nBack in March 2025, we released\nManaged Teams\nfor Premium and Enterprise customers. This allowed organization admins to sync an Atlassian team to a group to better control team information and membership, but this change meant the team name would change to match the synced group. Now, organization admins can change a managed team's name from the team profile and while staying synced to the group.\nTo change a managed team's name:\nGo to the managed team's profile.\nSelect the team's name, or select the\nTeam settings\nbutton.\nEnter the new name you want to use in the\nTeam name\nfield.\nPrevent people from downloading attached files\nROLLING OUT\nData security policies\nallow you to use rules to control how users, apps, and people outside the organization interact with content in Confluence and Jira.\nWe’re extending the\ndata export rule\nto also block the downloading of files attached to Confluence and Jira. After this rule takes effect, users will no longer find a download button in sections like the attachment list, macros, and file previews.\nWe opted to extend the data export rule rather than introduce a new one because of the considerable overlap between export and download. We found that organizations that needed to block exports also wanted to prevent attachment downloads.\nThis change will affect any existing policies that have configured the data export rule to block exports.\nThe data export rule requires Atlassian Guard Standard.\nTo check whether your data security policy currently block exports:\nGo to\nAtlassian Administration\n. Select your organization if you have more than one.\nSelect\nSecurity\n>\nData security policies\n.\nSelect a policy, and check whether exporting data is blocked.\nGet more work done in less time with suggestions in Jira Service Management\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re introducing suggestions on the issue view to help your teams gather context and start working on issues quickly based on a list of actions.

When your customers send requests to the email address connected to your project, the virtual service agent responds using Atlassian Intelligence answers.\nFind out more about using virtual service agent in email\nNew automation rules and the Service Triage Agent\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re introducing new automation rule templates that trigger the Service Triage Rovo Agent and use its responses to automate field updates for requests in your service project.\nCurrently, we’ve introduced the following templates:\nA rule that updates the summary based on the issue description\nA rule that updates the priority for an issue based on similar requests\nA rule that updates the request type for an issue based on similar requests\nA rule that generates a summary of the issue when it’s closed\nFor example, when a new request is created in your project, Service Triage can suggest a priority based on similar requests and update the priority field if the suggested value is different from the current value. The Agent also adds an internal comment to describe the updates, so that anyone working on the request can view the changes.\nThe fastest way to get started is to use a template:\nIn your service project, go to\nAutomation\n.\nSelect the\nTemplates\ntab.\nSelect the\nService Management\ncategory\nSelect a template and follow the prompts to configure it.\nWhen you use the template, you’ll need to connect Rovo to your instance.\nRead more about how to connect to Rovo\n.\nRead more about Rovo Agents in automation\n.\nThe 'External Assets Platform' Custom Field is shutting down\nROLLING OUT\nThe ‘External Assets Platform’ is shutting down as part of our ongoing efforts to deliver the most streamlined and integrated service management solution.\nLearn more about the shutdown of the 'External Assets Platform'.\nIf you’re a customer currently using the ‘External Assets Platform’ to add context to your Jira issues, we recommend you consider adopting Assets in Jira Service Management, available to Premium and Enterprise customers. Assets allows you to use the Assets objects custom field to display your objects on Jira tickets, and gives you the ability to display your Assets data within Confluence, along with many other features.\nJira: Grant permissions to manage versions (releases) in one project only\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now assign a dedicated\nManage Versions\npermission in Jira and Jira Service Management projects without giving full project admin access. Users with this permission can create, release, archive, merge, edit or delete versions within a specific project only. This applies to company-managed projects in Jira and Jira Service Management, and team-managed projects in Jira only.\nJira automatically grants this permission to users with project admin permissions.\nTo grant the\nManage versions (releases)\npermission in a company-managed project:\nGo to a project’s settings then select\nPermissions.\nUsing the\nActions\nmenu, select\nEdit permissions.\nUnder Project permissions, look for\nManage versions (releases)\n. Add the roles, groups, or people you’d like.\nSelect\nUpdate\nto save your changes.\nTo grant the\nManage versions (releases)\npermission in a team-managed project:\nfor tea,-managed projects, select\nAccess\nthen\nManage roles\n.\nSelect\nCreate role\n, then find\nManage\nproject name\nversions (releases)\n.\nAdd the roles, groups, or people you’d like.\nSelect\nUpdate\nto save your changes.\nIntroducing a brand way to delete multiple issues in the issue navigator\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re introducing an easier way for users to delete multiple issues from their projects.\nTo delete multiple issues from the issue navigator:\nSelect multiple issues from the list view in the issue navigator. You can either:\nuse the issue checkboxes\nhold\nCtrl\n(Windows) or\nCommand\n(Mac) while selecting issues\nhold the\nShift\nkey to select a group of adjacent issues\nThe new toolbar will appear. Select\nDelete\nto delete the selected issues.\nThe end is near for Epic Link and Parent Link fields\nCOMING SOON\nFor a little over a year, we've been working to combine the\nEpic Link\nand\nParent link\nfields in company-managed projects into the new universal\nParent\nfield (\nwhich you can read about here\n). To prevent data loss, the values from both fields have been automatically ported into the\nParent\nfield.\nWith this change, the values in the\nEpic Link\nand\nParent link\nfields are no longer visible on the Issue view. If your issue view still includes these fields, simply swap it for the\nParent\nfield instead.\nRead more in our documentation\nCreate unique, customizable pages in your help centers\nROLLING OUT\nJira Service Management Premium and Enterprise users can create and design landing pages in their help centers.\nAdmins can use landing pages to curate and efficiently organize help resources for specific subjects or audiences in a visually appealing manner.

Previously when filling out a form, customers would only be able to see the object name which made it hard to know what option to select. Now you’ll see the same attributes listed alongside each object - just like you do on request types.\nAdd and remove fields from field configurations; new tools to optimize fields in your projects\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re introducing a number of improvements to the way field configurations and field configuration schemes work. In addition, we’re also adding some new tools which make it easier to remove unused work types and fields from schemes. Here are more details about what’s changing.\nYou can now remove and add fields to field configurations\nRemoving a field from a field configuration is similar to hiding it. However, when a field is removed, its configuration isn’t preserved. It will need to be entered again if the field is re-associated.\nAdding a field to a field configuration is similar to unhiding it. Once unhidden, it becomes available to the projects associated with the field configuration scheme.\nYou can manage field associations in the Jira admin panel or using the new\nfield association REST API\n.\nWe’re releasing tools which allow you to optimize fields\nThese tools will automatically identify and remove unused work types from a scheme, as well as unused fields from a field configuration scheme and field configuration. For more details about these tools, see this\nAtlassian community announcement\nor type: entry-hyperlink id: 5m0df9oFEgswh305bKEQ1v\nUnlocking another level of help center customization\nROLLING OUT\nThe Jira Service Management help center is getting a sleek and modern design update across all its pages, offering new opportunities for customization.

Select the section you want to customize and manage its settings on the side panel.\nViews added to queues in Jira Service Management\nROLLING OUT\nWe're introducing the ability to choose how you view work items (issues) in your Queues in Jira Service Management. Providing more flexibility to support how your team likes to track and manage their work, this upgrade means there are now three ways to view each of your queues: as a list, a board, or a calendar.\nThe current default view of your queues will be renamed to 'list view' and will become just one of the ways you can view the work items in each queue. You can have different views on each queue and any views that you add will appear as tabs, allowing you to easily switch between the different views.\nYou need to be a Jira or project admin to add or remove views from your queues.\nAdd a view to a queue\nFrom your service project, go to\nQueues\nand select the queue to which you'd like to add a view.\nFrom your queue, select the\nAdd to navigation\nbutton. You'll find it in the tab bar between the queue name and the search bar.\nChoose the view you would like to add, then select\nAdd to navigation.\nOnce you've added multiple views to a queue, you can use the tabs to quickly switch between them.\nRemove a view from your queue\nFrom your service project, go to\nQueues\n, then select the queue from which you'd like to remove a view.\nFrom your queue's tab bar, hover on the view you would like to remove, then select\nTab options\nnext to the view name.\nSelect\nRemove\n. You can add the view again at any time.\nIn the\nTab options\nmenu, you'll also have the option to edit the name of each view and change its position on the tab bar.\nCustomize the settings for each queue's views\nThe ability to customize each view for each queue can be managed from\nQueue setttings\n.\nFrom your service project, select the\nMore actions\nmenu next to\nQueues\n, then select\nQueue settings.\nIn the\nActions\ncolumn, select\nEdit queue\nto access the settings for that queue.\nHere you can access the general settings for your queue, along with the specific settings for the list, board, and calendar views if you have added those views to the queue.\nValidate additional fields input in Atlassian Automation\nROLLING OUT\nWe're introducing a new feature that allows you to validate additional fields input in Atlassian Automation rules, including JSON syntax. This feature will help you to find possible warnings and errors that may impact your rule, so you can fix them before it runs. It'll be available across components that allow you to provide additional fields input, including the Create issue, Clone issue, Edit issue, Transition issue and Create incident actions.\nYou can also validate input containing smart values that are wrapped in double curly brackets, such as\nassignee.displayName\n. This feature has limited capacity to validate input that contains smart values without these brackets. We currently don't support validating input that\nonly\ncontains smart values (which may occur if you try to enter your JSON through smart values alone) or smart values sections.\nTo get started with this feature:\nOpen the Automation rulebuilder.\nSelect a trigger for your rule, plus an action that supports additional fields, like\nCreate issue\n.\nEnter your desired input into the Additional fields section.\nOpen the dropdown menu next to\nTurn on rule\n.\nSelect\nValidate rule\n.\nAny errors or warnings found in your rule, including the additional fields, will be displayed.\nFix any errors or warnings before turning on your rule. Warnings don't need to be fixed before the rule is enabled, but we recommend resolving them as soon as possible, to ensure your rule will run as planned.\nSelect\nTurn on rule\n.\nYour rule is now ready to use.\nLearn more about additional fields in Atlassian Automation\nNew Workato action in Jira Automation\nROLLING OUT\nWe’ve built a new integration with Workato. The integration connects your enterprise stack with Jira Service Management, unlocking powerful use cases for both IT and business teams.\nWith the new Workato integration you can connect and run Workato recipes, allowing you to fetch information and take actions across hundreds of applications directly from Jira Automation via the\nTrigger Workato recipe\naction in your automation rule.\nBefore using the\nTrigger Workato recipe\nstep or action for the first time, Premium and Enterprise Jira Service Management Cloud customers will need to create a connection with Workato by:\nGenerating a Developer API token and a Platform API/auth token from Workato.\nUsing these credentials to create a Workato connection from Jira Automation.\nYou can create a connection with Workato by creating an automation rule that uses the\nTrigger Workato recipe\naction. This action triggers a Workato recipe that runs at a specific point in an automation rule. You can use smart values to access Workato request response data in subsequent rule actions.\nRead how to create a Workato connection from Jira Automation\nRead how to set up the Workato action in your automation rule\nBack up and restore Jira Service Management Assets\nROLLING OUT\nAssets in Jira Service Management is now included in the backup and restore of your Atlassian Cloud services.\nMake sure you have the required permissions to use backup and restore features in your JSM site.\nGo to the backup and restore section in your Atlassian Cloud admin settings.\nFollow the steps to create a backup or restore your JSM Assets data.\nConnect and manage on-call schedules in Slack\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now connect on-call team schedules to your team's Slack channel and receive notifications about any changes to on-call shift changes.\nWhile connecting the on-call schedule to Slack, you can also set up an alias like !Hello that can be used to tag or @mention the current on-call member in a message. It lets you easily see who's on call and notifies the on-call member.\nTo link a schedule to your team's Slack channel,\nRun the command\n/jsmops oncall\non the channel and click\nConnect schedule\n.\nAlternatively, you can run the command\n/jsmops connect schedule\nto start connecting the schedule.\nAutomate entire business processes with advanced automation rules\nROLLING OUT\nAdd more functionality to your automation rule, allowing you to link multiple connected processes together in a single rule. This can help reduce the number of rules you need to maintain.

Find the new\nAdvanced component\ntype available to select from after you’ve added a trigger to a rule and select\n+Add component\n.\nWe've launched a new prioritization project template\nROLLING OUT\nWhen you set up a new project in Jira, you can use project templates. There are many to choose from, including specific templates from different apps like Jira Product Discovery and Jira Service Management.\nWe've just added a new template for projects that are all about gathering ideas and prioritizing them. With this new prioritization template you can list ideas and add data to them. You can then use this data with common frameworks (such as RICE) to prioritize. The project has multiple views, like an effort and impact matrix, list, or roadmap view, so you can see and share your priorities in a way that suits you.\nAnyone who has Jira Product Discovery and permission to create projects can use this template.\nTrigger an Automation rule during a virtual service agent conversation\nROLLING OUT\nUse the new\nrun Automation rule\nstep to trigger Automation rules during virtual service agent conversations!\nYour customers won’t notice when an Automation rule is run – it all happens in the background while they're chatting with the virtual service agent.\nFind out how to run an Automation rule in a conversation flow\nRecord a Loom directly from a task in Jira\nROLLING OUT\nIf you are in a Jira business project and open a task, you might see a small banner recommending Loom.\nLoom is a screen recording tool that integrates with other Atlassian apps, such as Jira. Screen recordings and videos are the best way to show people what you mean or explain something in visual detail.\nYou will have the option to add Loom quickly from the banner and record your screen directly within Jira. So, you can explain what your task comment or description means in clear detail.\nEnd users will see the banner but can't add Loom, they will send their admin a request for Loom instead. If you are an admin, you can add Loom from the banner. You can turn these recommendations off at any time from admin.atlassian.com.\nSee the Premium features in-product before starting a trial\nROLLING OUT\nWe're introducing a new and faster way to understand and upgrade to Jira Service Management Premium trial.

Select\nAdd\nto include new fields.\nIf you’re a team-managed project admin:\nSelect\n+ Create field\nto define new fields inline.\nNow you can create roadmaps from your Jira timeline\nROLLING OUT\nSometimes, you need a custom roadmap view to share your work plans with certain stakeholders. You may not need to include specific dates, for example. Now, you can access Jira Product Discovery from the Jira timeline view. Look for a button that says \"Create roadmap\" when you select the \"Share\", \" Today,\" or \"Timeline mode\" buttons.\nYou can use Jira Product Discovery to create custom roadmaps, then share them with anyone, even if they don't use Jira.\nOnly people who are admins and don't already have Jira Product Discovery will see this change. You dismiss it anytime.\nA new way to forward work items in Jira Customer Service Management\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now forward work items directly within Jira Customer Service Management.

This way, it'll be easier for you to understand the plan that is best for your team based on the features that plan includes. You can also easily upgrade and pay from the plans page.\nGet notified when email requests fail\nROLLING OUT\nProject admins now receive notifications right in their inbox whenever emailed requests are not processed successfully. This proactive means of communication ensures that admins are informed timely of failed email requests or connection issues with email accounts connected to their project.\nBy default, notifications are sent to all listed admins of a project. There is also an option to send these notifications to a specific email address instead of all admins.\nIn cases where self-signup is disabled or a customer doesn't have access to a service project, we will also notify customers so they are aware their request was not processed.\nTo specify who receives these notifications for your existing connected accounts:\nFrom your service project, go to\nProject settings\n, select\nChannels and self service\n, and then select\nEmail\n.\nSelect\nEdit\nagainst the required email address.\nEnter the email address of your choice in\nError notifications email address\n.\nSelect\nSave\n.\nEdit your workflows quicker and easier with the power of AI!\nROLLING OUT\nIn Jira sites that have Rovo enabled, the New Workflow Editor now includes an AI\nWorkflow builder\nagent that can help add, change, or delete statuses and transitions in a workflow. It can also answer questions about the key differences between the old and new workflow editor.\nWhile the agent is still learning, you can prompt it to add or remove the following rules from an existing workflow:\nRestrict who can move a work item\nUpdate a work item field\nValidate a work item field value\nChange an assignee\nCheck a work item field value\nThen select\nUpdate workflow\non the workflow diagram to save the changes it suggests.\nJourneys chart added to project summary\nROLLING OUT\nA new\nJourneys\nchart has been added to the metrics and charts that can be found on the project summary page.\nRead about the project summary page in Jira Service Management\n.\nNavigate to your service project, then select\nSummary\nin your project’s sidebar.\nAt the bottom of the page, you'll see the\nJourneys\nbar chart showing the count of in-progress journeys by journey name.\nNote that you'll only see the\nJourneys\nchart if\nJourneys\nis available in your project.\nRead more about journeys\n.\nIf\nJourneys\nis available but you are yet to create or run any journeys, you'll see a placeholder for the chart with a message that there's no journey data available. Create and run some journeys to populate the chart with data.\nAvoid accidentally deleting work items\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re changing the way Premium and Enterprise users delete work items to help avoid accidental deletions. When you attempt to delete a work item, you can now choose to archive it, or confirm that you want to delete it.\nCreate and manage email templates for stakeholder notifications\nROLLING OUT\nJira Service Management Premium and Enterprise users can now save time and customize stakeholder notifications on the go with email templates.\nEmail templates provide an easy and efficient way to customize stakeholder notifications. They eliminate the need to draft new emails from scratch, especially when teams are responding to incidents, allowing for quick customization and notification.

Our post outlines the full list of changes as well as how this fits into our larger plan. The Atlassian Community is also where we'll share updates, announce future changes in full detail, and engage with the community to make sure we're delivering an experience that meets your needs.\nThis first release includes changes that make field management simpler and more efficient for Jira admins, such as a redesigned\nFields\npage (formerly Custom fields) that now shows fields created by Jira or plugins (i.e., System fields). You can also create and add new fields to configuration schemes without leaving the page, and filter and sort fields based on\nField category type\n.\nEnhanced automation filtering and search experience\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re making it easier and faster for you to find what you need in Atlassian Automation.\nStreamlined template filtering:\nYou can now effortlessly filter templates by app and trigger, allowing you to quickly narrow down your options and find the perfect template for your needs.\nFaster and more reliable search:\nOur enhanced search capability ensures that results are displayed more quickly and reliably, so you can spend less time searching and more time automating.\nTo find new template filters:\nOpen\nAutomation\nfrom your Atlassian app.\nSelect the\nTemplates\ntab.\nNew ways to associate a field to a field configuration scheme in Jira Admin\nROLLING OUT\nWhen this feature rolls out, admins will be able to:\nassociate a new field to all of the field configurations used by a scheme without leaving the page, and\nview and edit which field configurations that field is a part of via the\nMore actions (•••)\nmenu on the\nFields\npage\nThis work is part of our ongoing efforts to\nimprove Fields management in Jira\n.\nAttachments now supported for the 'Send customized email’ action in Automation\nROLLING OUT\nWe’ve introduced the ability to add attachments to emails sent as part of your automation rules.\nOnce a rule has been saved or enabled, you’ll be able to upload files as part of the email content. When the rule executes, any uploaded files will be included as attachments to the emails that are sent.\nThis capability will be available when using the\nSend customized email\naction as part of your Jira automation rules, and will become available for use in other Atlassian apps in the future.\nRead more about the\nSend customized email\n[ action in Automation.|https://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/jira-automation-actions/#Send-customized-email]\nThis highly-requested update includes:\nAttachment support:\nYou can now add up to 10 attachments (in most file formats with a total size of 4MB) to your automated emails.\nSecure storage:\nAll attachments are stored securely in Atlassian’s media platform, ensuring reliability and compliance.\nEasy preview:\nOnce uploaded, you can open a preview of an attachment by selecting a card in the\nAttachments\nfield.\nTo add attachments to your automated emails:\nAdd the\nSend customized email\naction to an automation rule, then fill in the email details in the\nSettings\ntab.\nSelect the\nContent\ntab, then from the\nAttachments\nfield browse or drop the files you want to attach to the email.\nSelect\nUpdate\n.\nNote that the rule must be saved or enabled before you can add attachments to the email action.\nMore functionality in the new workflow editor, plus it's becoming the default experience\nROLLING OUT\nThis release has two small improvements which means the New workflow editor can do everything that the old workflow editor could do. These changes are:\nYou can set a name for your transitions when you create them, and rename existing transitions.\nWhen you change the name of a status that's included in a transition, the transition automatically updates to match the new name.\nAnd with those changes, the New Workflow Editor is a worthy successor to the old one, and we're excited for it to become the new face of workflow changes in Jira.\nThat said, Jira will use the new workflow editor by default when editing global workflows unless you've set the old editor as your default in settings. If you set the old as your default workflow editing experience, then nothing will change for you, but we are planning to deprecate it soon.\nFor now, enjoy the vastly superior new workflow editor. Let us know what you think by sending us feedback through Jira.\nPrompt inactive Confluence users to create content from work items\nROLLING OUT\nWe're introducing a feature that encourages inactive Confluence users to create content directly from Jira work items. This feature targets users who haven't been active in Confluence for the past 28 days and belong to sites that have had Confluence for more than 14 days. When these users view certain Jira work items, they'll see a suggestion to create a relevant project document in Confluence.\nTo start using this feature:\nOpen a Jira issue of type epic, story, or bug.\nLook for the Confluence content section.\nSelect the suggested template to create a project document in Confluence.\nFollow the prompts to complete and publish your document.\nAdd inline images to the 'Description' field on request forms\nROLLING OUT\nWe're rolling out a Help Center enhancement that allows images to be directly embedded in the\nDescription\nfield of a request form. This enables help seekers to provide screenshots, diagrams, or other images related to their requests and gives the support team the context they need to resolve requests quickly.\nTo maintain a clear distinction between embedded content and additional supporting files and to avoid duplication in the activity feed, inline attachments will appear in the\nDescription\nfield, and file uploads will appear in the\nActivity\nsection of the request, under the first comment.\nThis feature respects the attachment settings the admin has defined, which can be modified in the admin configuration panel for each request type.\nIn the request form:\nWhen attachments are enabled, users will see both the\nAttachment\nsection and the inline image icon in the rich text editor toolbar within the\nDescription\nfield.\nWhen attachments are disabled, neither the\nAttachment\nsection nor the inline image option will be displayed to honor the admin’s configuration selection.\nTo add inline images to the\nDescription\nfield when submitting a request from the Help Center:\nGo to your Help Center and start a new request.\nIn the\nDescription\nfield, select the image icon in the rich text editor toolbar.\nUpload or drag and drop an image to embed it in a specific position within the description. Repeat as needed.\nComplete and submit the request.\nWe're deleting unused field associations\nROLLING OUT\nStarting today (June 16, 2025), we’re beginning the process of removing unused field associations from your field configuration schemes. We expect this process to take several weeks from today. Once finished, this will improve the performance and stability of your Jira instances.\nIf this causes any issues in your projects, we have documented the steps for adding fields back in this\nAtlassian community announcement\n. The page also covers how we determine which associations to delete. If you have any questions about this scheduled deletion, you can ask them in the comments section of the linked announcement.\nAdd conditions to journey types now in Journeys\nCOMING SOON\nYou can now control if a specific work item should be created at all as part of a journey. For example, you may only want the ‘Assign office space’ work item to be created as part of someone’s onboarding journey if they aren’t a remote worker. Equally, you may have different work items needing to be created depending on the location, role or seniority of an employee.\nYou can also set up to five conditions on a work item with an AND operator. This means all conditions must be met. For example, you may have a work item for ‘Provision company phone’ with conditions such as:\nLocation equals Australia\nAND\nRole equals Manager\nAND\nEmployee type is one of FULL-TIME, PART-TIME.\nRead more about Journeys\nSet the default comment behavior in the work item view\nROLLING OUT\nWe're introducing the ability for admins to set the default behavior for comments on the work item view (in addition to transition screens, which has already been released).\nAdmins can now configure the default comment behavior at the instance level, ensuring that the setting aligns with their organization's communication preferences.\nAs part of this change, admins can choose whether comments default to 'Internal note' or 'Reply to customer' in both the transition screen and the work item view, enhancing control and flexibility in managing communications within a team's workflow.\nTo change the comment behaviour defaults:\nGo to\nSettings\n, then\nProducts\n.\nIn the\nJira Service Management\nsection, select\nConfiguration\n.\nIn the\nDefault comment behavior\nsection, select the desired defaults for both the work item view and transition screen.\nGroup by any field in list view\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now group work items in the list view by a wider range of fields, and quickly find your preferred grouping options with a new searchable dropdown that highlights your most recent choices.\nTo group work items by any supported field in the list view:\nGo to any Jira list view.\nSelect the\nGroup by\ndropdown at the top of the list.\nUse the search bar to find the field you want to group by, or pick from your five most recently used options.\nSelect your preferred field to instantly group your work items.\nTo create a new work item within a group, select the\nCreate\nbutton in that group (except for the Goals field).\nAdd web links to the top of your team profile\nROLLING OUT\nWe've consolidated all your team's important links to the \"Team links\" section at the top of the profile. Now, you'll see connected Jira, Confluence, and Loom spaces alongside any links to external tools or important pages.\nTo add links to your profile:\nGo to the team's profile page.\nFind the \"Team links\" section at the top, and select the + button.\nPaste in the link and change the display text if you want it to say something different.\nAllow Slack apps to trigger on-call alias responses\nROLLING OUT\nYou can now allow Slack apps, workflows, or webhooks to trigger Jira Service Management ChatOps responses using schedule aliases.\nPreviously, ChatOps only responded to alias messages sent by users. Now, when an app posts a message with an alias, you can allowlist it directly from the message shortcut menu. Once allowlisted, ChatOps will respond just like it does for user messages, making it easier to integrate bots, monitoring tools, and workflows into your on-call process.\nTo allow an app:\nHover over the alias message sent by the app, select the\nMore actions\nmenu >\nMore message shortcuts\n>\nAllowlist app\nJira: Fixing JQL query errors using AI is now generally available\nROLLING OUT\nWe’re excited to announce that AI-powered JQL error fixing is now generally available in Jira.\nThis feature automatically detects and suggests fixes for common issues, like syntax errors and typos, saving your time and effort when troubleshooting queries. It helps you quickly get to the work you need by making JQL easier and more reliable.\nSimply enter and run your JQL query. If there are any errors, they’ll be listed below the editor, along with an AI-generated, error-free query that you can review and instantly apply.\nSave playbooks as draft\nROLLING OUT\nCreating a meaningful playbook often takes time, and it may not always possible to have every detail ready upfront. To add flexibility to the playbook creation process, we’ve introduced a new\nSave as draft\nfeature for playbooks.\nWith draft mode, you can:\nSave your work and return later to complete it.\nBuild and refine playbooks at your own pace, without losing progress.\nSkip validations that are only required to turn on the playbook.\nNavigation: App shortcuts migrated to platform component\nROLLING OUT\nApp shortcuts in the sidebar now use a shared platform component, replacing previously product-specific implementations. There is no change to the user experience, but this update aims to streamline navigation across Atlassian products, improve app discoverability, and support future customization.\nReconfigure automation rules with Create feature flag in LaunchDarkly Action by June 30, 2025\nCOMING SOON\nWe are deprecating the “Create feature flag in LaunchDarkly” action in Atlassian Automation on June 30, 2025. As a result, the rules linked to LaunchDarkly and this action will cease to function as intended after this date. To prevent rule failures, all rules employing this action must be reconfigured on or\nbefore June 30\n, 2025.

This will help you organize, categorize, and filter your alerts based on specific criteria.\nTo add tags to a new or an active alert, select the more actions menu (•••), then select\nAdd tags\n.\nTo add tags to a closed alert, select\nAdd tags\n.\nYou can add multiple tags at once by separating them with commas.\nUse AI-powered support chat on Atlassian support\nROLLING OUT\nWe are excited to announce a new chat feature on our contact form. This feature uses\nAtlassian Intelligence\non the contact form to streamline the inquiry process and provide real-time assistance.\nFor more details, visit our website\nAtlassian Support\nTo use AI chat in the contact form:\nGo to support.atlassian.com/contact\nFill out the form, and let us know what you need and your URL.\nSome users might see an AI chat feature (Tell us about your problem) that will help you out by suggesting solutions\nYou can opt out and continue with the traditional form submission if you prefer.\nAccess media assets securely with IP allowlist restrictions\nCOMING SOON\nWe’re introducing IP allowlist restrictions for media asset domains. Only IP addresses on your organization’s allowlist will be able to access media assets (attachments, images, and videos) hosted on\nmedia-cdn.atlassian.com\nand\napi.media.atlassian.com\n.\nIf you use third-party security tools like Zscaler\n, make sure to allowlist [\nSource IP Anchoring\n|https://help.zscaler.com/zia/understanding-source-ip-anchoring]\n*.atlassian.com\nto avoid disruptions.\nThe cache invalidation takes effect 29 days after rollout. If you'd like this applied as soon as possible, update your IP allowlist policies for your tenants or contact us to invalidate the cache for you.\nTo prepare for these IP allowlist restrictions and ensure uninterrupted access to media assets:\nAllowlist the domain\n*.atlassian.com\nif you're using a third-party security tool (such as Zscaler).\nTest access to attachments, images, and videos from both internal and external networks.\nOpsgenie\nData residency moves: Choose where to host your Opsgenie data\nROLLING OUT\nOpsgenie data residency gives you control over where your Opsgenie account data is hosted. We support data residency moves (moving data across locations) for all Standard, Premium, and Enterprise plans for Opsgenie.\nTo request a data residency move in Opsgenie, go to\nSettings\n>\nApp settings\n>\nData residency\n.\nLearn more about data residency in Opsgenie\nFocus\nRecord and share Loom videos in the details of your focus area\nROLLING OUT\nIn the About section of your focus area, you can quickly record a Loom video that digs deeper into the details and adds that personal touch. If you already recorded one, you can also include that link.\nLoom videos can also be recorded when crafting an update that shares progress with your followers. Links to previously recorded Loom videos can be added there too.\nNavigation: App shortcuts migrated to platform component\nROLLING OUT\nApp shortcuts in the sidebar now use a shared platform component, replacing previously product-specific implementations. There is no change to the user experience, but this update aims to streamline navigation across Atlassian products, improve app discoverability, and support future customization.\nExpand all work items from sub-focus areas\nROLLING OUT\nWhen you are looking for work items that roll up to a focus area, you can drill down into the detailed information on the Work tab of that focus area. The table shows you the work items that were added to that focus area and all the work items in its sub-focus areas. Depending on the number of sub-focus areas and work items, you might need to expand several sections to see them all.\nTo make this easier, a toggle was added to the table's\nMore actions\n(•••) menu to always expand the work items. This choice is made per focus area and requires that the\nShow work from sub-focus areas\ntoggle is also turned on.\nSee the type of your work items\nROLLING OUT\nThe work that you add to a focus area can come from different Atlassian apps, and those work items can be a mix of types, like an epic, a project, or a theme. Rather than relying on icons to communicate the type of work, a column is dedicated to showing you the name of the type.\nWhen you see the list of work items on the Work tab of a focus area, the Type column is shown by default. If you find the type information less valuable and would like more horizontal real estate, you can turn off the column by selecting\nCustomize\nat the top of the table and toggling off the Type column.\nTalent\nTeams information now visible in Talent alongside positions\nROLLING OUT\nSee and filter positions by functional teams—powered by your HRIS connector—for clearer workforce insights.\nEnsure both Teams and Talent apps use the same HRIS connector (e.g., Workday). Once the HRIS connector is synced from Talent and enabled in the Teams app, teams will appear as a column in the positions table, and you can filter and view team details directly from

information, and problems with JQL queries.","raw_content":"Jira Cloud troubleshooting - Pacemkr\nSkip to content\nLog in\nStart your free trial\nMenu\nJira Cloud troubleshooting\nA list of potential errors and solutions when connecting to Jira Cloud\nThis page contains issues that may be encountered when trying to connect to your Jira instance through the Pacemkr wizard. Use this page to help you resolve the issue yourself before contacting support.\nThe Jira wizard is the gateway to connecting to your data. Pacemkr offers two versions of the Jira wizard. Based on your license, you can have a Jira wizard to\nBrowse through boards\nConnect directly to your Jira board\nThe two wizards have slightly different windows where the steps, although the same, are not in the same order.\nConnect and search boards\nConnect directly to a Jira board\nThe sections below detail the same problems that you may encounter in these two wizards. We use the name of the step to help the reader identify which step is the problem.\nStep – Authentification\nWhen trying to authenticate to Jira, a r red error message appears after the ‘Connect’ button is pressed.\nThe following are possible reasons why you would get the error message above.\nExpired Personal Access Token\nThe token you generated may have expired. Verify that your token is still active on your Jira profile page. In case your token is expired, it will no longer appear in the list. Simply create a new token by following the steps on this\npage\n. Afterward, try to log in to Jira again in the Jira wizard using the new token.\nBad URL of Jira instance\nThe Jira instance URL may not have been typed correctly in the URL field. Check that the Jira URL  address is correct.\nStep – Retrieve board information\nErrors about information linked to the board\nWhen Pacemkr is retrieving the board information, it collects the following information:\nColumns, their states, and the board filter\nEpics associated with this boards\nThe entire list of fields in Jira\nAs it retrieves this information, errors could occur like in the following image. On this image, the error will point to the specific step where Pacemkr got an error. Contacting support by informing them at which step the error happened will help them solve your issue faster.\nInvalid board\nA red error message appears when Pacemkr attempts to retrieve a board that doesn’t exist in Jira.\nThis error message is only displayed in the Jira wizard when you connect directly to a board. As Pacemkr tries to connect directly to a board with the following URL, it can encounter situations where the identifier is missing or typed incorrectly.\nhttps://app.pacemkr.ca/jiraBoard/<identifier>\nIt is possible the identifier has changed or has been deleted by the admin account which generated this identifier. Check with the administrator of your account to validate that this identifier is still valid. Also, there might be a typo when the URL was copied/pasted in the browser.\nStep – Fetch work items\nSearching for work items can lead to some problems. These are shown in the red error message that appears when the search has encountered a problem.\nThe following reasons can help you resolve the error encountered on this step.\nIncorrect JQL query\nThe JQL query may not run in Jira. This rarely happens. At this step, Pacemkr executes an enhanced version of the filter associated with the board information retrieved in the previous step. This improved version of the JQL query may not be interpreted by Jira.\nThis situation happens when the filter’s JQL query is already complex. Adding JQL pieces from Pacemkr may cause an error.\nTo resolve this issue, press the Copy/Paste button to the right of the date picker. Pacemkr will place the executed JQL query into the clipboard.\nPaste this query into the JQL search box in Jira. Run it and follow the error messages to correct the query.\nIf the board filter query is complex, a good practice is to start the query again and include one chunk at a time.\nInvalid permissions\nOn some occasions, the user who logged into this wizard is not allowed to see certain projects that are in the JQL query. To check this, press the Copy/Paste button to the right of the date picker. Pacemkr will place the executed JQL query into the clipboard. Paste this query into the JQL search box in Jira.\nRun it and follow the error messages to correct the query. If you do not have rights to view certain projects in this query, Jira displays a message informing you about this.\nJira tickets too heavy\nWhen Pacemkr runs a JQL search, it returns 100 work items at a time. However, Jira has a 6MB limit on the amount of data it can return to Pacemkr.\nIn other words, Jira returns 100 work items as long as their byte weight does not exceed 6 MB. If the tickets have a long history, it is possible that this limit of 6 Mb will be exceeded.\nTo resolve this issue, contact the team that maintains your Jira instance so that they can identify tickets that are too heavy.\nAdditional support\nIf the previous information did not help you resolve your issue, Pacemkr offers customer service from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays. In the event that none of the previous solutions worked, please write to Pacemkr support at\nsupport@pacemkr.ca\nShare\n< previous Post\nUnderstanding the throughput run chart\nNext Post >\nHow much data do you need?\nReady to empower your work teams?\nThis is your chance to invite visitors to contact you.

Which does not mean your assumption may be wrong, but many factors may be at play here:\nA Jira dashboard is composed of gadgets, some may be system gadgets, other may be linked to marketplace apps or even custom development;\nYour browser;\nYou network;\n...\nThe logs might tell you more, but since you can't access them yourself, I would suggest reaching out to Atlassian support and raise a ticket there directly so they can investigate:\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/contact/#/\nHope this helps!\nView More Comments\nYou must be a registered user to add a comment.

Recently, I've been working on a couple of client projects where we're using their cloud Jira.\nI was a bit shocked at some of the issues I've been running into:\nThe ability to move through search results is gone\n. Normally, I go to Issues, then enter a query which shows search results. If I pick the first ticket, I can then use the j and k keys to move forwards/backwards, or the u key to go back to the results. (There is also a little box in the top-right with up/down arrows and return to search.) That is completely gone now on both cloud Jira projects.\nSearching (using JQL) regularly crashes\n. I'll be typing something like \"PROJECT = ABC AND Sprint = \"Cre, then I select the sprint name from autosuggest, and then it freezes, and shows a dialog saying \"We couldn't edit the query The JQL builder is unresponsive. Refresh the page to try again.\" This happens all the time. It takes at least 5 tries to get a successful search result.\nTagging people in comments is extremely buggy\n. I'll start by typing @ then someone's name, then a few characters, then I hit tab, and I get someone else's name in there. It seems quite random.\nSetting values on fields in the issue screen is buggy\n. e.g. things like fixVersions get stuck in an \"unsubmitted\" state until I re-focus the field.\nThe whole front-end is very slow\n. Opening tickets, etc.\nIt's not just me - other colleagues are experiencing into this too.\nWhat's going on here? Did Atlassian just release a major front-end rewrite that introduced a bunch of issues?

The system has become noticeably slow, with extended loading times across various functions.\nSpecific issues I'm experiencing:\nIssue viewing: Takes between 1-4 seconds to load a single issue\nIssue board loading: Similar delays of 4-7 seconds\nTab switching: Consistently slow response time (1-7 seconds) when navigating between tabs or pages\nThese delays are affecting team productivity, as we spend considerable time waiting for screens to load throughout the day.\nI'd appreciate any suggestions on:\nPotential causes for this slowdown in Jira Cloud\nTroubleshooting steps to identify bottlenecks\nRecommended optimizations or configurations to improve performance\nWhether these load times are considered normal for Jira Cloud\nHas anyone else experienced similar performance issues? What solutions worked for you?\nThank you for your help!\nAnswer\nWatch\nLike\nBe the first to like this\nShare\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nCopy Link\n5588 views\n1 answer\n1 accepted\n1\nvote\nAnswer accepted\nNikola Perisic\nCommunity Champion\nJune 17, 2025\nedited\nHello\n@Asier Vadillo\nCurrently there is an active incident going on:\nhttps://jira-software.status.atlassian.com/\nEven if it's for child issues, it reflects on other issues as well, which is connected to boards as well.\nOnly troubleshooting you can try is to clear cache, start in incognito. If it's still the same, we would need to wait for Atlassian to solve this issue.\nView More Comments\nYou must be a registered user to add a comment. If you've already registered, sign in.

Since this appears to be a general, ongoing problem rather than a temporary incident, I'm wondering if there are other potential solutions or optimizations that could help improve the performance of our Jira Cloud instance.\nYou must be a registered user to add a comment.

It is always a good practice to narrow down the searches to speed things up.\nYou must be a registered user to add a comment. If you've already registered, sign in.

Jira Cloud, with the login page just refreshing after clicking 'Log In'.

After clicking the \"Log In\" button, the login page just refreshes.\nSolution\nBrowser settings\nThis usually occurs when Jira can't set a browser cookie. Ensure that cookies are allowed in the user's web browser settings,\nincluding ensuring 'Block all cookies' or 'Block third-party cookies' settings are disabled. Verify no Atlassian domains are restricted under site-specific cookie settings. If the issue persists, try clearing the browser cache and cookies, using Incognito mode, disabling any browser extensions or plugins, and updating the browser to the latest version.\nThis is not the only cause for this. You can also review any network and firewall rules that might be in effect. Often, we see that a new rule was added over the weekend that does not allow clients to access the instance.\nCheck user permissions\nCheck (in Admin > Global Settings > Global Permissions) that the user belongs to a group that has Jira access. If the access issue persists despite correct group membership, remove the user from the Jira access group and re-add them to re-trigger synchronization. This may resolve any misconfigurations.\nTry performing a traceroute from your location to the server. This will determine if there is a network issue. If you are unfamiliar with how to do a traceroute, see the\nwiki How to Traceroute\n.\nFix the issue by checking your browser and network\nClear the cache on the browser.\nTry a different browser.\nSee if a different user is having the same issue.\nDisable apps/extensions on the browser.\nCheck to see if the issue happens off the network/VPN.\nIf the issue persists, collect a HAR (HTTP Archive) file during the login attempt and share it with support for further analysis. \nFor detailed steps on how to generate a HAR file, refer to our documentation\nhere\nMake sure you are using a supported browser as documented in our\nSupported Platforms\n.\nIf your traceroute results look like the below please contact your network administrator to find out why.\nTake note if you see any indications of \"Request timed out\", which is a general way of letting you know that routing is getting held up.\nThe content of this article has been generated by AI\nUpdated on\nJanuary 29,

I am trying to find a way to submit one for Jira cloud and cannot find a way to do it. I am not allowed to create it from here:\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-69876\n- says no Edit rights\nI cannot do it from here either:\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/contact/#/\nI cannot make a product suggestion too:\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10440\nNothing works, it is very frustrating...\nAnd the bug I would like to submit is actually quite unpleasant one. Jira cloud is sometimes not displaying the full content of the description field and you can only see it if you click on it to edit. This creates a risk that the developers are actually missing out on some requirements and I have to ask them explicitly to always click on the description to be sure they have seen the whole of it.\nmasOS 11.1\nChrome Version 89.0.4389.90 (Official Build) (x86_64)\nAnswer\nWatch\nLike\nBe the first to like this\nShare\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nCopy Link\n784 views\n1 answer\n1\nvote\nKAGITHALA BABU ANVESH\nRising Star\nRising Star\nRising Stars are recognized for providing high-quality answers to other users.

What do you mean by: \"\nWe can raise our technical questions to \"Atlassian Support\" .\n\"? I could not find a way to raise anything to the support.\nWho could raise a ticket for me and where? The issue I would like to report is not a trivial one and could be very unpleasant for a lot of people using Jira cloud. They should be aware of it. I could not see/find a similar one raised so far.\nThanks,\nJenya\nYou must be a registered user to add a comment. If you've already registered, sign in.

We have a problem organizing bugs in Jira Cloud. First of all, we have a lot of bugs: on stage, on prod and bugs that come from releases.\nFor now, we organize bugs in Buckets (Epics in Jira Cloud) and within each topic -related Epics we create Buckets assigned to each developer in order to track the time they spend on bug fixing. We also release 5-7 times per week, so there are a lot of bugs.\nMy question is how better to organize such a huge amount of bugs and get rid of Buckets per person?\nWe tried to assign bugs to User Stories but our Velocity just jumps which our top management doesn't like.\nThank you for any advice\nbugs\nepics\nShare\nImprove this question\nFollow\nasked\nJan 13, 2024 at 19:15\nNataly Ginger\n11\n1\n1 bronze badge\n5\n1\nHow do you currently organize stories? There is nothing special about bugs, just work that's required. Also, why do you have so many bugs that you need a special form of organization? Are you addressing the root causes of the bugs, to reduce them?\nBogdan\n–\nBogdan\n2024-01-13 19:35:56 +00:00\nCommented\nJan 13, 2024 at 19:35\nCurrently, we use Epics, then split an Epic into User Stories. user Stories serve us as technical tasks so people log their time there. We usually don't use subtasks.  We have many bugs because we are working on three websites, and the nature of business requires from us to release frequently.  I know the current structure is a mess, so I am trying to fix the whole process step by step.  I recommended my manager split our team into 3 separate teams, but he was not ready to take the risk.   So the biggest pain now is the organization of Bugs.\nNataly Ginger\n–\nNataly Ginger\n2024-01-13 22:38:22 +00:00\nCommented\nJan 13, 2024 at 22:38\nI see that you have a your own way of using Jira and your question needs answers within that structure since any outsider answer may hit an issue like “it breaks this report”, etc. I suggest you get a consultant to analyze your Jira and your SDLC to provide you a better solution.\nNezih TINAS\n–\nNezih TINAS\n2024-01-14 05:53:47 +00:00\nCommented\nJan 14, 2024 at 5:53\n1\n@NatalyGinger: I would still say to manage them like the user stories. However,  this seems to me like an\nXY Problem\n. You should address the reason you have so many bugs. This statement seems to be the issue \"the nature of business requires from us to release frequently\". If the dev team is not given proper time to do a good job one, you will be doing the same job twice or more by constantly fighting against bugs.\nBogdan\n–\nBogdan\n2024-01-14 12:18:41 +00:00\nCommented\nJan 14, 2024 at 12:18\nAgree on Bogdan. You can kill as many bugs as you want... if they don't stop spamming at a faster rate than you address them, the whole process will fail anyway. It seems you already found the source of the problem (several releases with several bugs). Address this underlying problem and the bugs might decrease.\nTiago Cardoso\n–\nTiago Cardoso\n2024-02-16 09:13:10 +00:00\nCommented\nFeb 16, 2024 at 9:13\nAdd a comment\n|\n1 Answer\n1\nSorted by:\nReset to default\nHighest score (default)\nDate modified (newest first)\nDate created (oldest first)\n1\nYou Can't Fix Your System Just by Refactoring Ticket Management\nwe have a lot of bugs: on stage, on prod and bugs that come from releases\nThis is the X in your X/Y problem. You shouldn't really have three buckets of \"bugs\" for the same issue, unless the issues are environment-specific. Even then, I'd challenge the idea that they are truly separate issues.\nYour underlying issue is that gated environments should be conceptualized as a pipeline. For example:\nBacklog -> Development -> QA -> Staging -> Production\nBacklog <- (all bugs go here)\nIn other words, it doesn't matter where a bug is\nfound\n. If it's a bug in the product or service, then it should go back to the start of your loop, whether that's a backlog in Jira or directly to the development team for triage and disposition.\nThe only \"bugs\" that really belong to other stages are those that are environment-specific. For example, a gap in the Staging infrastructure itself is something that should usually be fixed in Staging by Staging engineers, not by developers. Even then, I could make an argument for \"shifting left\" and having infrastructure-as-code developed in Development and then\ntested\nin later pipeline stages.\nDifferent Environments May Use Modified Settings\nConsider the following, which should be developed and committed in Development but possibly tuned in other environments:\n# pseudo-code for per-environment settings\ncase environment\nwhen dev\n  set foo 1\n  set bar 1\nwhen qa\n  set foo 3\n  set bar 2\nelse\n  set foo 5\n  set bar 5\nend\nWith software, higher environments may need to tweak settings and use different credentials or data sources, but shouldn't be changing anything\nfundamental\nabout an application. If they uncover a bug, or a knob they can't twiddle, then that should be reported as a bug to Development. If you have QA, Staging, or Production making fundamental changes to an application, then you're doing the whole thing wrong anyway.\nUse Systems Thinking\nRegardless of your project management framework, environments should be considered testing gates on your way from \"not done\" to \"done.\" As such, the fact that you seem to be:\nWorking off of different backlogs in each environment is a \"process smell.\"\nReleasing to higher environments without adequate gate testing is another process smell.\nLacking feature toggles so that you can release often without breaking your build in higher environments is another process smell to consider.\nIn short, the whole cycle lacks\nsystems thinking\n. Each department is focused on itself, rather than collaborating together on a holistic CI/CD and testing pipeline that represents a low-friction cohesive process. Focus on fixing that, and the issue of how to represent the work within in your ticketing system will generally become self-evident.\nShare\nImprove this answer\nFollow\nanswered\nJan 16, 2024 at 15:56\nTodd A.

I've looked into it for a little bit and it seems that it is an issue caused by the CSS animation on the \"Add content\" button, which somehow triggers many rerendering events continuously.\nI'm using Mozilla 133.0 (64-bit), and also I've checked this on Chrome and it seems to be working fine.\nNow, I hope I am not really nitpicky about this, but I would just like to know if this issue is going to be addresed in any way? I don't think having my main thread maxed out when just having Jira backlogs open and doing nothing is okay, and this is not the only problem I've found, there are others, like when the user profile dropdown is visible something similar is happening and it also seems to affect my Chrome browser, or the frequent memory and cpu spikes.\nAnswer\nWatch\nLike\nBe the first to like this\nShare\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nCopy Link\n590 views\n2 answers\n1 accepted\n3\nvotes\nAnswer accepted\nBill Sheboy\nRising Star\nRising Star\nRising Stars are recognized for providing high-quality answers to other users.

Yes, I am on a Jira Free License.\nOn one hand, after reading your answer I've cleared the browser cache and cookies for Jira and I've disabled my extensions, but I am still encountering this problem.\nOn the other hand, a simple disable of the animation seems to fix this.\nYou must be a registered user to add a comment.

A quick look on that link shows that people as far back as 2020 wanted to have the option to disable these animations and unfortunately it seems Atlassian does not care about the site's performance.\nThank you for your insight!\nYou must be a registered user to add a comment.

recently\nAugust 23, 2024\nedited\nHello everyone! I'm Rene from Atlassian Cloud Support.\nI noticed that although our bug tracker jira.atlassian.com is well known by most people, we do not have any single place where it is possible to visualize all the work being done to improve Jira Cloud and as well as the systems and tools used to enable it to function like the Identity system and the Automation module.\nThinking on this, and taking inspiration from a similar dashboard in the On-premise side I assembled a JAC dashboard so customers can see what has been resolved in terms of bugs and feature requests in the Jira Platform, JSW, JWM, JSM, Identity, Migration, and Automation projects, as well displaying the recently resolved issues that you are watching or have voted on.\nThis dashboard can help you keep track of anything resolved without necessarily having to be watching actively a request, allowing you to see all the work that is being done on topics that you are directly interested in as well as all the other improvements and fixes delivered, in a single place.\nYou can find the dashboard at\n:\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=110790\nI'm more than happy to receive feedback and adjust the dashboard to make it more useful and let me know what you think!\nComment\nWatch\nLike\n17 people like this\n# people\nlike this\nShare\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nCopy Link\n6032 views\n15 comments\nBill Sheboy\nRising Star\nRising Star\nRising Stars are recognized for providing high-quality answers to other users.

[Atlassian Support]\nI suggest adding the\nResolution\nfield to the relevant gadgets to help to see final disposition.  Thanks!\nKind regards,\nBill\nLike\nRene C. [Atlassian Support]\nAtlassian Team\nAtlassian Team members are employees working across the company in a wide variety of roles.\nAugust 23, 2024\nedited\nHI\n@Bill Sheboy\nthe gadgets currently only consider one resolution for all the issues, Fixed. All the non-implementation ones (like Timeouts, Obsolete, Won't do, Duplicates) are filtered out.\nSince there are many feature requests that get bulk closed due to timeouts, lack of traction, being Duplicates, etc. as well as bug reports being marked as Duplicate, Obsolete, Not a bug, etc. maybe it is better to have a section just for Resolved issues with a Non-implementation cause.\nWhat do you think?\nLike\nJohn Funk\nCommunity Champion\nAugust 24, 2024\nedited\nThanks\n@Rene C. [Atlassian Support]\n- this is fantastic!\nI do have one question - what is the definition of the Timed Out resolution?\nLike\n•\nDave Mathijs\nlikes this\nBill Sheboy\nRising Star\nRising Star\nRising Stars are recognized for providing high-quality answers to other users.

[Atlassian Support]\nAtlassian Team\nAtlassian Team members are employees working across the company in a wide variety of roles.\nAugust 24, 2024\nedited\n@Bill Sheboy\nthat's correct, the filters are only considering the resolution \"Fixed\", as that is the only resolution used to indicate something has been fixed for bugs, or implemented for Suggestions/Feature requests. From your comments, I did some adjustments and additions:\nSince using the word \"resolved\" was too broad, I updated the names in the corresponding gadgets for Bugs and Suggestions/Feature requests to clearly indicate that they include issues Fixed. The idea is to keep one gadget for each issue type to highlight what has been implemented.\nUpdate\n: The resolutions for these gadgets now include \"Fixed\" and \"Deployed\".\nFollowing on the previous point, I added a new gadget that includes all the Bugs and Suggestions resolved with other resolutions besides \"Fixed\" and \"Deployed\", which are non-implementation ones. This gadget is called \"Jira Cloud Bugs & Features closed with a Non-implementation reason in the last 6 months\", it includes the Resolution field, and will show all Bugs and Suggestions/Feature requests resolved with all resolutions except \"Fixed\".\nAdjusted the gadget of \"Watched or voted by me\" to include all resolutions, as I agree that you would like to know what happened with all those issues you are following, not just which ones were implemented.\n@John Funk\n: since we at Support create the bugs and Suggestions, and our Product Managers and Dev teams take over after that I am a bit detached from the process but issues that haven't had a case reported (as Support does link support requests to the relevant Bugs and Suggestions), no comments or votes have been added in a certain time threshold, and had a low impact, among other criteria might be closed as timed out.  The closure comments added to issues resolved as \"Timed out\" usually indicate the reasoning.\nLike\nYatish Madhav\nRising Star\nRising Star\nRising Stars are recognized for providing high-quality answers to other users.

[Atlassian Support]\nHow can I watch updates on the dashboard?\nLike\nAvery W_ Krouse\nContributor\nAugust 27, 2024\nedited\nHi Rene, great dashboard! I think your “implemented” issue filter might not be catching tickets you’d expect. Example:\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-73607\nThe note at the top makes it seem like this was rejected, not implemented, but it is in your filter.\nAlso, left hand side of the dashboard at the bottom left, which free text plugin do you guys use? I want to install one into our dashboards.\nLike\nRene C. [Atlassian Support]\nAtlassian Team\nAtlassian Team members are employees working across the company in a wide variety of roles.\nAugust 27, 2024\nedited\nHi,\n@Yatish Madhav\n! Dashboards do not have a subscription system to be notified about changes in them, and this is because they don't work based on events, they have a series of gadgets and each gadget displays information based on a JQL query, so every time the page is loaded, or every 15 min (depending on the configuration of the gadget) the results are refreshed, but this happens on an individual gadget level, not on a dashboard level.\nIt is possible\nto subscribe to the individual Filters\nthat the gadgets use to receive daily, weekly, or monthly emails with the results and I will link the JQL queries used in the dashboard here so you can subscribe to the ones you are interested in:\nI'm also discussing this with our staff to ensure the correct resolutions are set to avoid this type of confusion.\nFilters:\nCloud only: Watched or voted by me Resolved (Any cause) in last 6 months\nCloud Only: Issues fixed/deployed in the last 6 months\nJira Cloud Bugs & Features closed with a Non-implementation reason in the last 6 months\nJira Cloud Bugs fixed in the last 6 months\nJira Cloud Suggestions Implemented in the last 6 months\n@Avery W_ Krouse\nThank you for pointing that out. The issue\nJRACLOUD-73607\nwas resolved with the cause \"Fixed\" so it was appearing under the \"Implemented\" gadget, as that is what that resolution is meant to indicate. This was an error by the user that marked the issue as resolved and this has been corrected to now indicate the actual resolution (\"Won't do\"), making it appear in the \"Non-implemented\" gadget now.\nAdditionally, the gadget I am using for free text is called \"Rich Text\", which is only available on Server/Data Center versions of Jira.\nLike\nAvery W_ Krouse\nContributor\nAugust 27, 2024\nedited\nSo you’re saying that the tickets for Jira cloud are being hosted on Jira data center? Hmmmmmmmm…\nLike\n•\nPaul Christie\nlikes this\nRene C.

Each work item collects and displays the information your team needs to collaborate into a set of fields. A work item's status, priority, and resolution represent some of the most important fields describing and reporting on your team's work. They give your team at-a-glance information about where the work is in your workflow, how important it is to your goals, and a description of how the work was completed.\nThis page lists the default statuses, priorities and resolutions that come with your Jira products. Jira admins:\nfind out about creating your own statuses, priorities, or resolutions\n.\nWork item statuses\nA work item’s status indicates its current place in the\nspace\n's workflow. Default statuses are created when you create a\nspace\nfrom one of our templates. The statuses are recommended starting points for each template, but you can edit or remove them from a workflow to suit your team's need. You can also create your own.\nHere's a list of the statuses that come with Jira\napps\n, depending on what\nspaces\nyou've created on your site.\nOpen\nThe work item is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.\nIn Progress\nThis work item is being actively worked on at the moment by the assignee.\nDone\nWork has finished on the work item.\nTo Do\nThe work item has been reported and is waiting for the team to action it.\nIn Review\nThe assignee has carried out the work needed on the work item, and it needs peer review before being considered done.\nUnder review\nA reviewer is currently assessing the work completed on the work item before considering it done.\nApproved\nA reviewer has approved the work completed on the work item and is considered done.\nCancelled\nWork has stopped on the work item and is considered done.\nRejected\nA reviewer has rejected the work completed on the work item and is considered done.\nDraft\nFor content management and document approval\nspaces\n, the work described on the work item is being prepared for review and is considered in progress, in the draft stage of writing.\nPublished\nFor content management\nspaces\n, the work described on the work item has been published and/or released for internal consumption.

From here, work items are either marked assigned or resolved.\nResolved\nA resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter. From here, work items are either reopened, or are closed.\nClosed\nThe work item is considered finished. The resolution is correct. Work items which are closed can be reopened.\nBuilding\nSource code has been committed, and JIRA is waiting for the code to be built before moving to the next status.\nBuild broken\nThe source code committed for this work item has possibly broken the build.\nBacklog\nThe work item is waiting to be picked up in a future sprint.\nSelected for Development\nThe work item is verified and has been selected to be worked on in the future.\nJira Service Management statuses\nIf you have Jira Service Management, you also get these statuses by default, depending on what\nspaces\nyou've created on your site:\nDeclined\nWaiting for support\nWaiting for customer\nPending\nCanceled\nEscalated\nWaiting for approval\nAwaiting CAB approval\nPlanning\nAwaiting implementation\nImplementing\nPeer review / change manager approval\nWork in progress\nCompleted\nUnder investigation\nWork item priorities\nA work item's priority indicates its relative importance.

But let’s get to the real reason I’m writing this article. If you manage Jira or work with API's in your organization, you’ve probably noticed changes in the Jira Issue Search API.\nNow, if you’ve been keeping up with Atlassian’s developer\nchangelogs\n, this won’t be news. But regardless of whether you were following or not, the bottom line is: the API is changing, and that means some things will break. I’m talking about those scripts, automations, or little tools you wrote ages ago and forgot about, which quietly keep your systems running.\nWhile this change might cause some headaches, it’s not all bad news. In fact, the old API had its issues. It pulled large amounts of data with little control, forcing you to parse unnecessary information. The new API, on the other hand, lets you request only the fields you need. This makes responses smaller, faster, and easier on memory.\nHowever, not everything is smooth sailing. For instance, the\nstartAt\nparameter is gone. It’s been replaced by\nnextPageToken\n, which actually improves performance—but it does mean rewriting parts of your code.\nAs someone who builds and maintains automation around Jira, I’ve already adapted to this with my Python library,\njiraone\n. If you’ve seen my previous posts, you’ll know this library supports tasks like exporting issues, getting changelogs, calculating time-in-status, and more—all of which used the old issue search API.\nWith version\nv0.8.7,\nI introduced support for the new API, making it easier for admins and developers to transition without losing much functionality.\nBasic Usage\nHere's how you can use the new API with\njiraone\n. See the docs for more information about the arguments you can use.\nExample: Simple GET Request\n# previous import statement\nresp = LOGIN.get(endpoint.search_cloud_issues(\nquery='project = AT',\nfields=None,\n)\n)\nif resp.status_code < 300:\ndata = resp.json()\nprint(data)\n# {[\"issues\": [...]]}\nThe reason I used\nfields=None\nis that I don't want to return all field data. You can specify what field you want returned by typing a string of the field name separated by a comma. If the argument is removed, by default, all fields are returned, which will be a large payload to parse. The\nquery\nargument expects any valid JQL and requires a bounded query, which means you have to specify exact search restrictions; otherwise, it won't work.\nExample: POST Request (for larger queries)\n# previous import statement\nresp = LOGIN.post(endpoint.search_cloud_issues(\nquery='project = AT',\nmethod=\"post\",\nfields=None,\n), payload=endpoint.get_issue_search_payload)\nif resp.status_code < 300:\ndata = resp.json()\nprint(data)\n# {[\"issues\": [...]]}\nNotice that you don’t need to create a payload, but what happens here is that by defining the arguments you want, it is automatically added as an object when you call\nendpoint.get_issue_search_payload\nand assign it as a value to the payload argument of\nLOGIN.post\nTo handle pagination (since results may span multiple pages), you need to loop using the\nnextPageToken\n:\n# previous expressions\nif resp.status_code < 300:\ndata = resp.json()\nwhile \"nextPageToken\" in data:\nif \"issues\" in data:\n# the issues will be a list which you can loop\nissues = data.get(\"issues\")\n# you can attach the issues data to another object\n# or process it the way you see fit\nresp = LOGIN.get(endpoint.search_cloud_issues(\nquery='project = AT',\nfields=None,\nnext_page=data.get(\"nextPageToken\")\n))\nif resp.status_code < 300:\ndata = resp.json()\nEnhanced Function:\nenhance_search\nTo simplify pagination, I added the enhance_search function in the jiraone.utils module. It automatically handles paging and returns all results with a total count of how many issues it's returning. For those of you thinking of making multiple APIs, this handles that request quite nicely.\nGET Example\n# previous import statement\nfrom jiraone.utils import enhance_search\ndata = enhance_search(endpoint.search_cloud_issues(\nquery='project = AT',\nfields=None,\n)\n)\nprint(data)\n# {[\"total\": 287, \"issues\": [...]]}\nPOST Example\n# previous import statement\nfrom jiraone.utils import enhance_search\ndata = enhance_search(endpoint.search_cloud_issues(\nquery='project = AT',\nmethod=\"post\",\nfields=None,),\nmethod=\"post\" )\nprint(data)\n# {[\"total\": 287, \"issues\": [...]]}\nNote: Both\nsearch_cloud_issues\nand\nenhance_search\ntake a\nmethod\nargument. If using POST, you must set\n\"post\"\nin both places.\nPutting It All Together\nHere’s a quick example using a config file and script:\nconfig.json\n{\n\"user\": \"myuser@example.com\",\n\"password\": \"MY_API_TOKEN\",\n\"url\": \"https://yoursite.atlassian.net\"\n}\nPython file, e.g.\nmyscript.py\nfrom jiraone import endpoint, LOGIN\nfrom jiraone.utils import enhance_search\nimport json\nfile = \"config.json\"\nconfig = json.load(open(file))\nLOGIN(**config)\ndata = enhance_search(endpoint.search_cloud_issues(\nquery='project = AT',\nmethod=\"post\",\nfields=None,\n), method=\"post\"\n)\nprint(data)\n# {[\"total\": 287, \"issues\": [...]]}\nIf you’re using Jira DC, you can continue using the older\nendpoint.search_issues_jql\n.\nThis change may be disruptive in the short term, but it opens the door to more efficient, flexible scripting. Hopefully, this article helps you adapt your tools and keep your Jira automations running smoothly.\nComment\nWatch\nLike\n22 people like this\n# people\nlike this\nShare\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nCopy Link\n53271 views\n4 comments\nErick Miranda Márquez\nContributor\nApril 24, 2025\nedited\nGreat explanation!

troubleshooting guide for issues with Jira Cloud integration, including steps to safelist IPs, check Jira configurations in PagerDuty, and troubleshoot common issues like Jira issues not creating PagerDuty incidents and vice versa.","raw_content":"Jira Cloud Troubleshooting Guide\nStep 1: Pre-Checks\nIP Safelisting Requirements\nBefore starting the troubleshooting process, please safelist the required PagerDuty IP addresses:\nHow to Safelist IPs\nList of Webhook IPs\nStep 2: General Troubleshooting\nIn PagerDuty\nCheck the Jira Cloud Configurations in PagerDuty\n: Navigate to\nIntegrations\nYour Integrations\nJira Cloud\n. Verify if there is a configuration connecting the PagerDuty service to the Jira project and issue type.\nNote the Jira Issue Type\n: Check if the configuration correctly associates with the affected Jira issue type. Each configuration associates to a specific issue type - for example, if a configuration associates to the type\nTask\n, then its configuration rules will not apply to other issue types, such as\nBug\n.\nCheck the Creation Type\n: Navigate to the configuration rule and review the option selected in the\nCreation Type\nfield. Confirm if the option selected matches the expected issue creation behavior. In\nAutomatic\nmode, PagerDuty will automatically create a Jira issue in the associated project.\nManual\nmode will require responders to generate a Jira issue from the incident page (navigate to the\nMore\ndrop-down menu\nCreate Jira Issue\n).\nReview incident status mapping\n: Review the PagerDuty incident status to Jira issue status mappings, to confirm that the PagerDuty statuses are mapped correctly to the expected Jira issue status.\nComplete the priority mapping section\n: If you enabled priorities for your PagerDuty account, complete the priority mapping section to map PagerDuty incident priorities to Jira issue priorities.\nSome Jira issue fields may be required\n: Confirm which Jira issue fields are required for that Jira project and issue type. In the\nJira Field mapping\nsection, there must be a PagerDuty field mapped to each of the required Jira fields. Required fields are indicated with an asterisk:\nIn Jira Cloud\nWorkflow mapping\n: The issue workflow for the Jira project should contain a transition that would allow the issue to change from its current status to the desired status.\nIf the issue persists after completing these general troubleshooting steps, please refer to the following section for more specific troubleshooting steps.\nStep 3: Troubleshooting Some Common Jira Cloud Issues\nPagerDuty Incident did not Create a Jira Issue\nIn PagerDuty\n:\nOn the Jira Cloud Integration page, there should be a configuration linking the PagerDuty service to the Jira project and issue type.\nConfirm if the option selected in the\nCreation Type\nfield matches the expected issue creation behavior. If you’ve selected the\nmanual\nissue mode, the responder must manually create a Jira issue from the\nMore\ndrop-down menu on the incident page.\nIn Jira\n:\nCheck if there are any conflicting automation rules configured to process incoming webhooks, or handle automatic issue creation.\nNavigate to the project settings and check the valid issue types for this project.\nMapping a PagerDuty field to an incompatible Jira issue field may also prevent Jira issue creation. Check that the PagerDuty fields mapped to each Jira field match the data type expected for that field.\nJira Issue did not Trigger a PagerDuty Incident\nIn PagerDuty\n:\nNavigate to the configuration rule in PagerDuty, and copy the JQL statement. In Jira, verify if that JQL statement returns the Jira issue in the results.\nIf Jira issues matching the JQL statement should trigger a PagerDuty incident, the\nCreate an incident if the issue matches the JQL statement\nsetting should be enabled.\nThe Jira project and Jira issue type are automatically appended to the JQL filter, according to the project and issue type selected in the configuration rule. At this time, the JQL filter cannot match other projects or issue types not selected in the configuration rule.\nIn Jira\n:\nConfirm if the issue matches the project and issue type defined in the configuration.\nIf Jira issues should not automatically trigger a PagerDuty incident, then responders should manually trigger incidents from the PagerDuty widget in the issue sidebar.\nPagerDuty Incident Status and Jira Issue Status did not Sync\nIn PagerDuty\n:\nOn the incident page, confirm if the Jira issue is linked to the PagerDuty incident. The Jira issue must be linked to the incident in order to sync the incident record between the two platforms.\nIn the configuration rule, there should be a mapping between the PagerDuty incident status and the desired Jira issue status.\nNote\n: Jira cannot change the state of a PagerDuty incident to \"Acknowledged\". This ensures only PagerDuty users can acknowledge an incident is being worked on.\nIn Jira\n:\nCheck if there is a workflow transition for that project and issue type, which would allow the issue to transition from the current status to the desired status.\nConfirm if any automations are transitioning the Jira issue to a different status than the one you expected.\nThe PagerDuty application cannot transition issues to or from statuses that are not mapped in the configuration rule. To review the issue’s status change history, navigate to the issue’s\nActivity\ntab and look for updates indicating a status change.\nPagerDuty Incident Fields and Jira Issue Fields did not Sync\nIn PagerDuty\n:\nIn the configuration rule, there should be a mapping between a PagerDuty field and the Jira issue field. Check the mapping to confirm that the correct PagerDuty field is being mapped to that Jira issue field.\nThe mapped fields are synced the moment the Jira issue is created - Jira fields do not get updated/synced after this point.\nIn Jira\n:\nNavigate to the project settings to verify if the field is available for that issue type. The Jira field data type should correspond with the PagerDuty field data type.\nCheck if there are any conflicting global or project automations that also populate this issue field.\nThe issue field must be placed on a screen that is mapped to the create issue operation via a screen scheme. The screen scheme must be mapped to the issue type via a issue type screen scheme that is associated to the Jira project.\nA Jira Ticket is Triggering Multiple PagerDuty Incidents\nIn PagerDuty\n:\nIn the configuration rule, the JQL statement for automatically triggering a PagerDuty incident should include an Open/To-Do status (as defined by your company) so that a PagerDuty incident is only triggered when the issue is first opened/created.\nConfirm if a duplicate incident was triggered manually from PagerDuty, or from the PagerDuty widget in the issue sidebar.\nCheck if there are any project-level or global-level automations which would have created a duplicate ticket.\nVerify if there is a duplicate configuration rule mapping the Jira project and issue type to the same PagerDuty service.\nTLS Certificate Errors\nMost commonly, this error occurs when:\nA certificate in the chain has expired\nThe certificate being used is self-signed or from an issuer not trusted by PagerDuty\nThe certificate chain is out of order\nThere is a duplicate certificate in the certificate chain\nPagerDuty expects all certificates in the chain to be active, sent in the correct order (with no duplicates) and signed by a trusted root. The below openssl command, or a tool like\nSSL Labs\n, may be helpful in identifying issues with the certificate chain.\nPlease note that the port for your Jira instance may be different from the default 443:\nopenssl s_client -connect <jira url>:443 -showcerts\nPlease see our article on\ntrusted root certificates\nfor more information.\nA  PagerDuty Incident Generated Multiple Jira Tickets\nThis may occur if your Jira instance takes 15 seconds or more to complete the entire process: create issue, sync notes and status, update fields, etc. In this case, the integration will retry the webhook, resulting in the creation of a duplicate Jira issue.\nIncident Notes & Issue Comments are not Syncing\nThis may occur if:\nThe user selected to enable notes sync is no longer active in your PagerDuty account.\nYour Jira Admin has defined specific project permissions required to post issue comments.\nYour Jira instance was experiencing a network issue at the time the comment was being created.\nPriority is not syncing between Jira and PagerDuty\nTo map priorities between Jira and PagerDuty, your PagerDuty account must have access to the priorities feature, and your PagerDuty Admin must\nConfigure Incident Priority\n.\nIf your account does not meet these two requirements, then you will see the following message:\nAdditionally, priorities must be available for the issue type defined in your configuration rule. If the issue type does not meet this requirement, then you will see a message that priorities are not available for the issue type. Please see the example below:\nYour Jira Admin should verify the following:\nThe Jira issue priorities that you want are\nmapped to a priorities scheme\nin Jira.\nThe priorities scheme is correctly\nassociated to the Jira project\n.\nThe priority field is available for that issue type in the Jira project (Project Settings > Issue Types > select an issue type to view the available fields).\nCreate a Test Issue Did not Create a Test Issue\nPlease note that the\nCreate a Test Issue\nfeature creates an issue in Jira Cloud, but it does not trigger an incident in PagerDuty.\nWhen the test issue is created, the integration will transition the test issue from the Jira issue status mapped to triggered to the issue status mapped to resolved. Therefore, you will need a workflow transition in Jira that directly connects these two issue statuses.\nSome Jira issue fields may be required\n:\na. Confirm which fields are required for that Jira project and issue type.\nb. Confirm the data type expected for each field.\nThere should be a PagerDuty attribute mapped to each required field. The PagerDuty attribute data type should also match the data type expected by that field.\nJQL Tips\nTo test the JQL statement in your configuration rule\n: paste the JQL statement in your configuration rule to Jira, to confirm if that query returns the Jira issue as expected.\nIf your company has access to\nAtlassian Intelligence\n, you can leverage this tool to assist you in writing the JQL statement. Alternatively, you can explore other AI chat assistants if access to this tool is not available. To test the JQL statement, use the testing method above.\nFor additional details regarding JQL, please reference the resources linked below.\nAdditional Resources\nJQL Fields\nJQL Fields\nJQL

If your board is trying to display more than 5,000 work items at once, you'll receive an error message, and be prompted to update your filters.\nProject and work item keys\nWork item keys\nWork item keys are unique identifiers for every piece of work you track with Jira. They are easily recognizable and quick to remember.\nYou'll see keys:\nOn work items themselves, as a label\nIn search results and saved filters\nOn cards on your boards or in a project's backlog\nIn links connecting pieces of work\nIn the work item’s URL\nAnywhere you need to reference the work you're tracking\nWork item keys are made up of two parts:\nThe project key (“SMART” in the screenshot above)\nA sequential number\nProject keys\nProject keys are a series of alphanumberic characters that describe to people across your Jira site what pieces of work are related to your project. They're the most memorable and recognizable piece of a work item’s identifier. For example, our team is codenamed Donut World. We use the project key \"DONUT\" to help people across Atlassian know and recognize work that relates to our team.\nProject admins can create and assign their project's key when they create a new project. Based on the project's name, Jira suggests a recognizable key. If you're a project admin, you can customize this while creating a project by selecting\nAdvanced\noptions. You can also update it in the project's settings. They must be at least 2 characters long and start with an uppercase letter.\nRead more about editing a project's details\nIf you have\nadmin permissions\n, you can\nconfigure work items, create new work types, manage custom fields, and more\n.\nWas this helpful?\nYes\nNo\nIt wasn't accurate\nIt wasn't clear\nIt wasn't relevant\nProvide

That action can be a task, a bug, a feature request or any type of action your organization might need to work with. Work items are the core of the Jira apps since all the team collaboration happens around the work items and their organization. You can customize your own work types creating work item sets associated per\nspaces\n, and even per permission types.\nTo configure the layout of the work item—which fields appear and the order they appear in—open a work item and choose\nConfigure\nat the bottom-right.

I'm new to Atlassian and Jira as a whole. This might come off as a confused rant, so I apologize if that's the case.\nI want to use Jira Software. I cannot find it anywhere. I've seen some YouTube tutorials about Jira Software while trying to figure out Jira, and I wanted to move over to that, but I am stuck with Jira.\nMy reason to believe that they are 2 separate things is first of all, the logo. On my screen it only says Jira, while on YouTube it says Jira Software.\nThen, I do not have a backlog. It would be very helpful to have one.\nFurthermore, my Dashboard looks different and seems to have slightly different features and lacks the features that I would want.\nI'm sure there are other functionality related differences as well, like time logging, but I am not experienced enough as of right now to comment on that.\nI understand this might be a stupid question, but please bear with me. I've been trying to figure out how to customize Jira to look remotely similar to what I've seen online and it's a painful process.\nI would like the following questions answered, if possible:\nAre Jira and Jira Software 2 separate things?\nIf so, then is there a free version until up to 10 team members for Jira Software?\nWhere can I find Jira Software, or how can I switch to it? (I have tried going through\nadmin.atlassian.com\nthen Apps and New Apps and it's just not working, I cannot find it anywhere)\nI tried making another Atlassian account to make sure that I picked Jira for Software Development in the setup stage, but it did not change anything. I also tried customizing the side bar to add a backlog, but it's nonexistent.\nI would honestly appreciate it if someone could help me out with this.

Data Center KBs for non-Data-Center-specific features may also work for Server versions of the product, however they have not been tested.\nSupport for Server* products ended on\nFebruary 15th 2024\n. If you are running a Server product, you can visit the\nAtlassian Server end of support\nannouncement to review your migration options.\n*Except Fisheye and Crucible\nSummary\nJira issues don't appear in the Plan, Scrum or Kanban Boards, or reports visible within those boards.\nSolution\nCommon causes\nFor Scrum and Kanban boards\nThe board's filter is blocking some issues. Keep in mind that the board's filter controls the visibility of issues everywhere on the board, including all Agile reports.\nYou have a\nquick filter\nthat was selected on the Board. Any issue filtered out by the quick filter will be hidden from the board\nThe user does not have the appropriate permissions to view or edit those issues.\nMapped columns to statuses are not mapped in the board's configuration.\nThe affected issues were not reindexed.\nThere are Issue Types or Statuses that use numbers (1, 2, 3, and so on).\nThe project has been renamed, and the filter still uses the old name.\nFor Scrum boards only\nThe context of the\nSprint\ncustom field is not set to global.\nThe\nSearch Template\nfor\nSprint\ncustom field is not set to\nJira Software Sprint Field Searcher.\nOnly the first column is populated with statuses on the board configuration. In such a case, all issues from the\nBacklog\nand any\nFuture Sprint\nwill be missing from the Board, even if they are in a status mapped to the first column.\nThe\nSprint\ncustom field is hidden through\nField Configurations\n.\nThe\nActive Sprint\nsection is empty, but issues will still be listed on the backlog.\nThe missing issues are in a status that is linked to the\nDone\ncolumn in the Board configuration, and the missing issues either belong to the\nBacklog\nor a\nFuture Sprint\n(a Sprint that has not started yet).\nThe missing issues are of type\nSub-Task\n. By design, sub-tasks are not displayed on the Board Backlog page. NOTE: Sub-tasks will be displayed in the\nActive Sprints\npage.\nFor Kanban boards only\n'Fix version' is set to 'Hide' in the 'Field Configurations' page.\nSub-Filters may hide issues.\nOn a Kanban board,\nthe Epics Panel\nis enabled, which will move all Epics to the backlog.\nOn a Kanban board,\nSwimlanes\nare enabled.\nList of solutions\nFor Scrum and Kanban boards\nMake sure\nno issues are blocked by the board's filter\n—Configuring filters\n. If the board filter retrieves issues based on an additional field, such as a custom field or label, ensure that each of the issues that should be shown in the board and their Epics have the correct custom field\nor label value.\nUnselect the\nquick filter\n. Refer to\nConfiguring Quick Filters\nfor more information.\nVerify that the user has access to those issues by using the\nJira Admin Helper\nplugin or by accessing the issue directly.\nMap the columns in the board's configuration to the correct status. For more information, please refer to\nConfiguring columns\n.\nMake sure that Jira Software is re-indexed (Full Reindex) -\nSearch indexing\n.\nMake sure there are no Issue Types or Statuses that are integers, as this is a known bug tracked under\nJRASERVER-31898 - Naming a Status or Issue Type as an integer causes problems with the JQL in JIRA, breaking several areas\n.\nModify the board's filter to use the new project name or key -\nConfiguring filters\n.\nFor Scrum boards only\nSet the Sprint's custom field contexts to 'Global' or to the projects to be used in Jira Software.\nFor more information, refer to\nConfiguring a custom field\n.\nSet the Sprint's custom field\nSearch Template\nto\nJira Software Sprint Field Searcher.\nFor more information, refer to\nConfiguring a custom field\n.\nMake sure your board has multiple columns populated. Jira Software will consider the last column that's filled in as the end column. Please refer to\nConfiguring columns\nfor more information.\nMake sure the sprint custom field is not hidden in the Field Configurations page -\nSpecifying field behavior\n.\nYou can add issues to active sprints by editing the issue directly or dragging it to the active Sprint in the backlog.\nThis is expected behavior. If you want the issue in the status linked to the Done column to show on the Board, either start the Sprint (on-going Sprints show Done issues), or move the issue to a status other than Done\nThere is no resolution for this root cause, since this is the expected behavior by design\nFor Kanban boards only\nSee\nJira Software Kanban board does not show all issues\n.\nSee\nJira Software Kanban board does not show all issues\nand\nConfiguring filters\n.\nPlease refer to\nConfiguring columns - Kanban Backlog\nand disable the\nEpics Panel.\nSwimlanes\nmay filter issues such as Epics if you have\nBase Swimlanes on Epics\nselected. See\nConfiguring Swimlanes\nto disable it.\nAdditional Troubleshooting\nThe following troubleshooting steps will also be helpful if the above does not resolve the problem:\nTry accessing the filter directly that is used for the board (\nTools > Configure > Filter > Click on the Saved Filter\n).\nIf results are returned, however, they are not returned through the board; it may be due to additional causes. We can verify this by enabling some additional logging and then seeing exactly what JQL Jira Software is using to return issues.\nEnable the extra JQL logging by setting\ncom.atlassian.jira.issue.search.providers\nto\nDEBUG\nin\nLogging and Profiling\n.\nReload the board. This will give you the JQL in the logs that JIRA Software is using in the logs, e.g.:\n2013-03-01 15:48:35,607 http-8910-9 INFO allyourbase 948x1325x2 5a6eo1 172.22.2.187 /rest/JIRA Agile/1.0/xboard/work/allData.json [issue.search.providers.LuceneSearchProvider] JQL query: {issuekey = \"CDSSF-442\"} AND {status in (\"3\", \"1\", \"6\", \"5\", \"4\", \"10022\", \"10020\")} AND {cf[10370] in openSprints()} order by Rank ASC\nTake that JQL and run it directly against the Issue Navigator. For example:\nissuekey = CDSSF-442 AND status in (\"3\", \"1\", \"6\", \"5\", \"4\", \"10022\", \"10020\") AND cf[10370] in openSprints() order by Rank ASC\ncf[10370]\nis the Sprint field in this example.\nThis can help identify any problems with that JQL where the error may not be reflected in the board. If the Sprint field is hidden on the Field Configuration, you may face the problem described in this article:\nThe Jira search page shows the error \"XXXX does not exist or you don't have permission to view it.\"\nIf that's your case, follow the steps on that page to resolve it.\nUpdated on\nSeptember 26, 2025\nWas this helpful?\nYes\nNo\nIt wasn't accurate\nIt wasn't clear\nIt wasn't

You can also link individual Crashlytics issues to Jira issues.\nPrepare Jira for integration with Firebase\nThis Firebase integration supports Jira Software Cloud but not Jira on-premise implementations.\nCreate an API Token (Jira Cloud only)\nBefore you set up the integration in Firebase, you have to generate an API token in Jira Cloud.\nTo do that, open Jira's\nAPI tokens settings\n, then click\nCreate API token\n. Save this API token somewhere secure, as you'll need it later.\nCreate a \"Bug\" issue type\nThe Firebase integration with Jira creates issues with the type\nBug\n. You'll need to create this issue type if it doesn't already exist in your project:\nIn the Jira console, navigate to Project Settings.\nClick\nIssue types\n.\nClick\nAdd issue type\n.\nSelect \"Bug\", or enter it manually.\nSet up the Jira integration in the Firebase Console\nJira Cloud\nSign in to the Firebase console, then select your project.\nClick\n, then select\nProject Settings\n. Select the\nIntegrations\ntab\n.\nOn the\nJira\nintegration card, click\nInstall\n.\nClick\nSet up Jira integration\n.\nEnter your Jira project URL in the following format:\nhttps://[workspace-name].atlassian.net/projects/[project-key]\nEnter your Jira login email and your API token.\nClick\nVerify & save\n.\nJira Server\nSign in to the Firebase console, then select your project.\nClick\n, then select\nProject Settings\n. Select the\nIntegrations\ntab\n.\nOn the\nSlack\nintegration card, click\nInstall\n.\nClick\nSet up Jira integration\n.\nEnter your Jira project URL in the following format:\nhttps://[server-name.com]/projects/[project-key]\nEnter your Jira login email and your API token.\nClick\nVerify & save\n.\nFor more information on how to get your Jira project key, see the\nJira Core Support site\n.\nConfigure alert settings\nYou can configure alerts by app and event type. For example, you can turn off alerts in your testing app or route alerts about different apps to different Jira projects.\nEvent types\nThe Firebase integration with Jira allows you to send alerts in response to four event types:\nNew issues\n: triggered when your app experiences a crash that Crashlytics hasn't seen before.\nNew non-fatal issues\n: triggered when your app experiences a non-fatal issue Crashlytics hasn't seen before.\nRegressed issues\n: triggered when your app experiences a crash that you'd previously marked closed.\nIncreasing-velocity issues\n: triggered when a single crash or ANR type impacts a percentage of users in a 30-minute period for a given app version.\nConfigure settings for each app\nBy default, the Firebase integration with Jira doesn't post any kind of alert to your specified Jira projects.\nHere's how to configure alerts for each app in your Firebase project:\nSign in to the Firebase console, then select your project.\nClick\n, then select\nProject Settings\n. Select the\nAlerts\ntab\n.\nGo to the\nCrashlytics\nalerts card. Select the app you want to configure from the dropdown menu.\nSelect the Jira project where you want to send alerts for this app.\nFor each type of alert, select from the dropdown whether you want to send that type of alert to Jira.\nRepeat these steps for each app that you want to configure.\nThat's it! Firebase will post bugs to your specified Jira projects if your apps have new, regressed, or increasing-velocity issues.\nLinking Crashlytics issues and Jira issues\nIn addition to the automatically-created Jira issues that Firebase creates, it's possible to link your Crashlytics issues to existing Jira issues. You can also create a new Jira issue from the Firebase console. You'll need to enable the Jira integration before using this feature.\nNavigate to the Crashlytics issue you'd like to link to a Jira issue.\nClick\nLink to Jira\n.\nEither click\nCreate issue in Project\n, or paste your Jira issue URL or issue key in the space below.\nUnlinking a Crashlytics issue from a Jira issue\nNavigate to the Crashlytics issue you'd like to unlink from

The description/comments in these issues are so large that when JIRA attempts to read these issues, it will run out of memory.\nSome details on this behaviour\nJRASERVER-28519 - JIRA dies with OutOfMemoryException when rendering issues with numerous and/or large comments\nSince Jira 5.0.3, comment length can be limited by using\njira.text.field.character.limit\n. However, there is no default value (ie. no limit on characters) so administrators will have to specifically set a value if they want to limit characters in a text field\nSince Jira 7.0, the default value has been set to 32,767 characters\nSolution\nIf these issues are particularly large, deleting them will resolve the problem. This should be done by getting the ID from the queries above and deleting them by accessing\nhttp://<BASE-URL>/secure/DeleteIssue!default.jspa?id=<Issue ID>\n. The issue must be deleted through the GUI otherwise it can leave orphaned records in the database that may still be causing problems.\nIf deletion is not possible, the next recommendation would be to delete the individual comments instead. You can extract the comment from the DB and attach it to the ticket as a file to retain the data.\nIdentify how the issues are being created or how these comments are being entered and address this to prevent it from continuing to happen.\nSet the value of\njira.text.field.character.limit\nto a sensible value. The default is 32,767 characters. You can set it higher if you wish, but keep in mind that the higher it is, the higher chance that it will cause this problem. You can set the value using 2 methods\nVia the UI\nNavigate to (Settings > System > General Configuration > Advanced Settings)\nSearch for\njira.text.field.character.limit\nModify the value accordingly\nThere should be a 'Revert' button if this is a custom value. Clicking on it will update the value to 32,767\nVia the jira-config.properties file\nRefer to the following article on more information on how to configure this:\nEdit the jira-config.properties file in Jira server\n.\n⚠️\nFor mail this is only applied in JIRA 6.3.12 and higher as per\nJRASERVER-38357 - Text field size limit ignored by incoming mail handlers\n.\nUpdated on\nSeptember 26, 2025\nWas

I've tried to fix the issue by limiting RAM usage, reinstalling, updating, removing plugins but it's still crashing. I run it on\nDebian 9 (Stretch) with 2 GiB of RAM, using Apache and running Jira 8.12.1 as a service, mySQL database. Maybe running it on OVHcloud VPS is an issue? I'm not an experienced user in setting up services like that although I've tried my best and still there is an issue with stability. Attaching support zip to help verify the issue.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1NV2-2LCQmVJKS1rNwmW_54i11FgCULJh/\nSzymon Kwiatkowski\nAnswer\nWatch\nLike\nBe the first to like this\nShare\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nCopy Link\n1160 views\n1 answer\n1 accepted\n0\nvotes\nAnswer accepted\nFractal Fox Missler\nI'm New Here\nI'm New Here\nThose new to the Atlassian Community have posted less than three times.

discusses common issues in Jira Service Management Cloud, focusing on the Customer Portal, notifications, and permissions. Solutions are provided for problems like administrators not seeing all tickets, customers not receiving notifications, and customers unable to see requests in the Portal.","raw_content":"Understand common issues in Jira Service Management Cloud | Jira and Jira Service Management | Atlassian Support\nSkip to main content\nUnderstand common issues in Jira Service Management Cloud\nPlatform Notice: Cloud Only\n- This article only applies to Atlassian apps on the\ncloud platform\n.\nSummary\nDiscover solutions to frequent requests in Jira Service Management, focusing on the Customer Portal, notifications, and permissions.\nSolution\nAn Org & Site and Jira administrator can’t see all tickets in the Customer Portal\nThe Customer Portal is a place where customers can view the tickets they created and the ones shared with them (Organizations and Request participants).\nThe filters on the Portal are hard-coded coded which means that they can’t be changed.\nWhen accessing Requests >\nCreated by me,\nthe filter would be:\nreporter = currentUser() AND resolution is EMPTY\nVia the\nRequests\npage, the current user who is logged in can select different statuses and request types to better filter the requests.\nWhen changing from\nCreated by me\nto another option from the dropdown, it will show the following tickets:\nAll\nIt will show all tickets where the current user is the Reporter, Request participant, or tickets shared with an Organization the current user is a member of.\nWhere I am a participant\nIt shows tickets where the current user is not the reporter, but a Request participant.\nShared with my organizations\nIf the current user is a member of more than one Organization, the tickets from all Orgs will be shown when using this filter.\nThe reason why a Site/Org and Jira administrator can’t view all the tickets via the Customer Portal is due to that.\nAs an administrator, the correct place to view all the tickets is direct via the Project Queues or via Filters > Advanced search.\nThe customer is not receiving notifications about updates to their tickets\nThere are two main reasons why a customer doesn’t receive notifications of their request.\nThe Request type is empty on the ticket:\nWhen the Request type is “None” it means that the customer won’t be able to view the ticket via the portal and the notification also won’t be triggered.\nAn empty Request type happens when a ticket is created via Jira (Create button on the topbar) or when a ticket is moved between work types or projects.\nCustomers only receive notifications if this field is correctly set.\nTo prevent the Request type from being empty, refer to the following documentation:\nAutomatically set Customer Request Type When Issue is Moved or Created via Jira\nChoose default request types for your issue types\nCustomer unsubscribed from notifications:\nEach notification has a link where customers can turn off notifications and they can also disable it directly via the Customer Portal.\nOther common reasons:\nThere is an\nsecurity level\nset to the ticket that doesn’t include the Reporter and Service Project Customer - Portal Access.\nCustomers marked notifications as spam, so even though notifications are being sent by Jira, they won’t receive them.\nCustomer notifications are disabled via Project settings > Notifications > Customer notifications.\nThe customer created a rule on their mail client to automatically move Jira notifications to another folder or to automatically delete them.\nThe customer is unable to see the request in the Customer Portal\nThe causes for this problem are similar to the previous one. Additionally, if a user has duplicate accounts (e.g., portal-only and Atlassian accounts), it can lead to ticket visibility issues. Confirm if the user has duplicate accounts, and if so, migrate the necessary data from the portal-only account to the Atlassian account and deactivate the portal-only account. Ensure the user logs in with their Atlassian account credentials. These actions can prevent further disruption in ticket access.\nFor the ticket to be visible in the Portal\nIt must have a Request type.\nIn case there is an Issue Security, the security level must include the Reporter and Service Project Customer - Portal Access. If users encounter visibility issues despite having permissions, verify that the security level explicitly includes the groups or roles needed for access. For instance, ensure 'Service Desk Team' security levels are configured to include participants like 'Service Project Customer - Portal Access.'\nThe person trying to access the ticket must be the Reporter, Request participant, or member of an organization the ticket was shared with. If a user faces issues adding request participants, ensure they have the 'Browse Users and Groups' global permission. Without this permission, users can only add participants already associated with the ticket (e.g., as customers). Administrators can resolve this by assigning the user to a group with this permission or directly granting the permission.\nThe ticket needs to be under a Service project.\nWhen a ticket is created on a Service project and then moved to a Jira project, the customer won't be able to view it until the ticket is moved back to a Service project.\nMore reasons and detailed information can be found in the documentation below:\nKnown problems with viewing requests on the customer portal\nA Jira administrator is unable to configure the Service project\nIn order to manage a Service project, the requirements are:\nHave a Jira Service Management license.\nHave Jira administrator permission.\nBe listed as an Administrator via Project settings > Access > People and access.\nNote that the Administrator role must also have Service Project Agent permission.\nRelated documentation:\nStandard permissions in Jira Service Management\nConfigure projects\nCollaboration between Jira teams\nOverview of Jira Cloud permissions\nA user was added to the Service Desk Team role, but once they log in they are redirected to the Customer Portal\nAdding a user without product access to the Service Desk Team role via Project settings > People will not allow them to view the project internally. A Service Management agent is a combination of a Service Management license and the Service Desk Team role.\nAlso, adding a Jira Software user to the Service Desk Team role won't allow them to act as agents; they will need a license.\nCollaboration between Jira teams\nThe assignee of a ticket can’t see the ticket in the portal\nAn assignee can only view a ticket in the portal by clicking on\nView request in portal\ndirectly on a ticket.\nAccessing the Customer Portal and clicking on Requests won’t show tickets assigned to an agent.\nAs mentioned in the first topic of this documentation, only the Reporter, request participants, and members of an Organization with which the ticket was shared can view the requests when accessing the portal. The assignee can only access the ticket via the direct link on the internal tickets.\nThe ticket doesn't transition when the agent or customer adds a comment\nOn the Legacy automation and on Automation, it’s possible to create a rule to transition tickets from Waiting for Support to Waiting for Customer and vice versa when a comment is added.\nSometimes, this rule won’t transition work items, and the most common cause is the Assignee also being listed as a Customer role. This means the Assignee is listed as a Request participant or member of an Organization the ticket was shared with.\nTo prevent these permission issues, it’s important to ensure that the Assignee is not added as a Participant or added to Organizations.\nIn case other agents need to receive notifications or also collaborate on a ticket, they can set themselves as Watchers.\nOther than issues with the Automation, adding an Agent as a Participant or Member of an Org can cause issues with SLAs.\nJSDCLOUD-7546 - The condition \"Comment: For Customers\" won't trigger the SLA to stop if the agent is a request participant or member of the same organization as the customer\nA Jira and Project administrator can’t view Queues, Reports, and other options on the project sidebar\nWhen adding a new Org, Site, and Jira administrator, depending on the Product access settings, a Jira Service Management license is not automatically granted.\nIf a Jira administrator who is also a Project administrator is unable to view specific features on Service projects, such as Queues, Reports, Change calendar, Customers, Knowledge base, among other features, it’s due to not having a Service Management product access (license).\nHow does product access work?\nGive users access to products\nUpdated on\nJanuary 5, 2026\nWas this helpful?\nYes\nNo\nIt wasn't accurate\nIt wasn't clear\nIt wasn't

Atlassian provides a bundle of Jira products, each designed to tackle a particular use case and to cater for its customer needs.\nJira Software:\nthe original Jira product which is designed for software development teams that utilize agile methodologies.\nJira Service Management:\npreviously known as Jira Desk Service is designed for IT and service teams for customer support to manage incidents, changes, requests and problems.\nJira Work Management:\nMeanwhile this Jira  product, formerly known as Jira Core, is designed for non-technical teams like HR, Marketing, and Leal teams that require a project management tool. It offers features like project templates. For instance, a Campaign Management template for Marketing Teams.\nJira Product Discovery\n: This is the latest Jira product Atlassian has added to its Jira bundle. It is intended for product management teams to turn their ideas into successful products. Jira product discovery allows product managers to gather , organize and analyze product inputs, communicate with stakeholders, and connect their work to their teams. Thus making data-driven decisions.\nAlthough Jira products may appear distinct, they share some common features  that underpin their primary functionality as a project management tool. One of the essential features across all Jira products is Issues. Jira Issues are by far the fundamental macro that constitutes the value of Jira products.\nFind out more about Jira Products wit tis Atlassian\nWhat are Jira Issues? And Why are they important?\nJira Issues are  a matter that requires some sort of action from a project team member. They are Jira tickets created to simplify and depict each problem and actions required to resolve it.\nFor instance -Let’s say you are a Marketing Team Lead- you need to plan for a product campaign for a new product update, to promote and market it. But, how can you document every step, and every action? how can you assign and keep track of each team member’s work and progress?\nIssues are most definitely your go-to macro. They facilitate not only your work by dividing each major step into a detailed task, and every quest into a sub-task. But also, Issues facilitate your role as a team lead to monitor and track your team members’ work progress using the assignee and reporter Jira native fields.\nFor a more detailed tracking process, leverage Jira reports to monitor project and issue progress efficiently.\n👉 Find out more in our article about\nJira reports\nFor such project, you just need to create a new space by selecting the campaign management template in jira work management. Now, you can create different issues, where you can only select a task as an issue type. Which is great! As you can see, for a marketing campaign plan, your issues are evidently tasks.\nDon’t worry we’ll get into the different types of Issues later in this article!\nYou can now create tasks, and organize them using the workflow macro which can be tailored to suit your  needs.\nList of Types of Jira Issues:\nAs each issue stands for one single action, they definitely facilitate tracking project progress.\nHowever, there are several types of Issues! So what are Issues types?\nTo simplify this part, we provided a table that summaries Issue Types according to the Jira Product.\nLater on, we’ll dive deep into each Jira Issue type, and include some use cases to really break down Issues Types in simple terms.\nJira Product\nIssue Types for this product\nJira Software:\nTask\nStory\nBug\nEpic\nSub-Task\nJira Work Management\nTask\nSub-Task\nJira Service Management:\nIT Help\nService Request\nService Request with Approval\nChange\nIncident\nProblem\nPost-Incident Review\nJira Product Discovery\nIdea\nWe’ll explain the hierarchy of Issue Types in a Jira Project, starting from the bottom and moving up, for better understanding.\nSub-Task:\nA sub-Task is a child Issue type that is part of a larger Issue Type such as Task, Bug, or Story.\nIt’s used to break down larger Issues Types such as Task into smaller and more manageable components.\nA sum of Subtasks leads to the completion of a Task. Say you have a project that requires multiple people working on it. Sub-tasks facilitate managing the work across your team members as they are smaller pieces of work.\nTask:\nA task is the work you need to do. It’s basically an activity that doesn’t fall under the label of other Issue types. This term broadly defines work that needs completion, without the need for a separate issue type.\nFor instance, a task in your campaign management template can be to draft a report to analyze previous campaigns’ performance.\nStory:\nA Story is a requirement that describes a functionality or features from the viewpoint of an end-user. It is user-centric and is often used in agile software development to break down a project into smaller and manageable pieces.\nBug:\nA bug is a known term for DevOps and in the IT world.  It stands its meaning in the Jira context. A bug issue type is an issue reflecting a problem with software under development that impairs or prevents the product from performing adequately.\nEPIC:\nEPIC incorporates all previous Issue Types. EPIC is generated from an agile management approach, it serves as a parent to other Issue Types. EPIC helps teams organize and plan work that might span multiple sprints, projects, and versions.\nThese were the first issue types that Jira made available to its users. They give your teams flexibility in how they structure their work. Jira Issues Types also offer a wide range of customization options. You can modify the meaning of specific issue types within the context of your project, incorporate specific information using custom fields for each issue you create, and and customize your project workflow to align with your project type and specific issues.\nJira recognized the need to enhance its issue types to align with the ITSM framework when creating Jira Service Management. Thus, the JSM product templates offer different issue types, to cater to the unique needs of its ITSM-oriented user base. These are the Issues Types for Jira Service Management:\nJira Service Management Issue types:\nService Request\nAs its name suggests, a service request is a user request for customer support. Users can raise service requests for IT help, to ask for a new update, etc.\nService Request With Approval:\nService request with Approval is also a  formal  user request but it requires compliance from higher-ups.\nIT help:\nAn IT help is an Issue created when you need help from your IT  team specialists. For instance, your company-issued laptop is malfunctioning, and it is disrupting your work. You should create an IT help Issue to raise this problem, and request a solution. So, you can describe your issue, assign an IT specialist to review this issue, and add any information that might be helpful to understand the situation. Thus, it is not necessary to reach out to the IT team in person or via email, wait for them to respond, and have a long discussion to communicate the issue.\nChange Issue:\nChange Issue type is a request to make a cane to a service or a product. For instance,  A change Issue can be about a new product feature upgrade. Say, you have a product, you can use the change Issue for a new UI interface for your mobile application product version.\nIncident Issue:\nAn incident issue is used to report an unplanned interruption that may disrupt the service. For instance, an incident issue can be created to report an IT-service outage that may interrupt your customer support service. Your customer support portal is down for example, this implies that  your clients are unable to access the portal to raise their tickets. Your team should  prioritize this type of issue and respond immediately.\nPost-Incident review:\nFollowing the resolution of an incident issue, a post-incident review issue type can It can actively prevent future incidents and generate ideas for improvement.\nProblem Issue:\nSimilar to an Incident and a chance, Problem Issue type  is also inspired from the ITSM framework process- Problem Management. While multiple incidents can occur, some of these incidents can be recurring. A problem is generated, indicating an underlying root cause of multiple incidents. The problem issue type focuses on identifying and resolving the root cause to prevent future incidents from occurring.\nThese ITSM-focused issues are specific to Jira Service Management project templates. As a Jira user, it may sound a bit hectic to retain all at once, but practice makes perfect! and Jira is with you along the way to facilitate your work. One or perhaps the most strong  suite Jira equips you with is its flexibility. Jira products already filter your drop-down Issue types menu according to the Jira product ,your project type, the Jira template you selected.\nWhilst there’s more for Issues Types. Do not fret! As Jira Product Discovery is a newly adopted Jira product, so there is limited options when it comes to issue types.\nFollowing the Team’s 22 announcement of the New Jira product- Jira product Discovery, Atlassian layed out more details during the  “Unleash” event in the first quarter of 2023. As Jira Product Discovery is afterall a Jira Product, Issues constitute a big chunk of it. Focusing on its distinct target audience-Product Managers- for Jira Product Discovery, Jira introduced a new type of Issues -“IDEA” .\nIdea:\nIdea is essentially an issue where you include a product idea. This issue includes native jira fields such as summary, assignee, and description. However, the Idea issue incorporates new native jira fields tailored to include information about product ideas such as Teams working on the Idea, Roadmap, Goal (such as “Win Large Customers”),etc.\nSteps to Create your First Jira Issue\nIt’s great that generating an issue is a simple process in Jira, as you’ll be spending a lot of time dealing with issues. At first glance, Issues might seem like a headache with so many types. But it is easier than it seems!\nIn order to create a new issue in a new project or an existing one, you just need to follow these simple steps:\nNavigate to your desired Jira product:\nYou can navigate to an existing project page or create a new space for your project.\nSelect a Jira-native template:\nThis only applies in the case of a new project!\nCreate a new project:\nAfter selecting your jira product and template , set your project name and Jira will automatically provide a unique key. Now, click “Create”.\nOn your project landing page,\nclick “Create”:\nWhether you just created a new project or you navigated to an existing one, you will open your project landing page, where you will find a visibly distinctive blue button “Create”. Click on it and a “Create issue” panel will then appear.\nSelect your Jira issue type\n, a\nnd\nfill out the necessary fields\n:\nFill out the required information. You can add or remove the already customized issue fields as necessary..\nFinally\n,\nClick “\nCreate\n”.\nDon’t Worry! We’ll be sure to explain each step in more detail.\nSimply click the blue “\nCreate\n” button in any Jira product. Luckly, Jira uses a unified theme for its generic features like creating an issue, rendering your issue creation process literally a single click away.\nThe “Create issue” panel will then appear, and you can add or remove fields as necessary. This screen is totally customisable.\nA list of default fields will appear. The displayed fields will vary depending on the Jira issue type. For example, if you select a “Task” Issue type, Jira native fields include Summary, Description, Attachments, Issue Priority, etc\nYou can change the project space of the new issue in the project area, and you can select the type of issue you’re working on in the issue type field drop-down menu.\nAdditionally, you can provide a description, attach files, and provide a summary about your issue.\nYou can also set the issue’s priority level and link related issues together.\nJira Issue Fields\nSome of the native Jira fields that exist across all types of Jira Issues are:\nAssignee\n:\nWith this field, you can specify who is responsible for resolving this issue. For instance, if the issue is an IT help, the assignee should typically be an IT specialist in your organization.\nReporter\nof a Jira Issue\n:\nThis Jira native field is where you can specify the person responsible for creating and reporting the issue. Simply put, It is typically the person who discovered the issue or is responsible for raising it to the teams’ attention.\nPriority:\nThis macro allows to set a priority status to your issue ranging from highest to lowest\nLabels\nin a Jira Issue:\nYou can select a label to facilitate filter and search of your issues later on, as well as enhance your issue organization. Labels help teams locate issues across their Jira instance by categorizing similar issues that do not belong to the same story or EPIC.\nLinked Issues:\nYou can use this field to link other issues that are related to your current issue. For instance, you can link different sub-tasks to a bug, or story issue type it’s related to.\nOnce all is set, click “Create,” and you’re good to go! You just created a new issue for your project.\nJira offers multiple Jira Issue Types to cater to each Jira Product’s target audience, their task-specific demands, and the Jira template they chose to work with. Afterall, Jira Issues are one of the foundations of the Jira platform as a whole.\nThis article only scratches the surface of Jira Issues! But, Fear not! In subsequent blogs, we’ll be sure to dive deeper into some specific Jira issue use cases before moving on to explore other Jira Pillars like the Jira Dashboard.\nWas this helpful?\n✅ Thanks for your feedback\nStay in touch !\nJoin our newsletter\nRelated\ncontent\nMore posts\nAtlassian Tips\nDecember 9, 2025\nHow Inline Comments in Confluence Enhance Team Collaboration\nLong Confluence pages, scattered feedback, and conversations spread across Slack, email, and Jira, collaboration can quickly get messy.

well as software engineers, often use Jira Software as a bug reporting tool to track and effectively manage software bugs. One of Jira’s most powerful features is the\nworkflow\n- the defined path an issue takes from creation to completion. A\nperfect\nbug workflow ensures every bug is documented, assigned, tracked, and resolved, allowing teams to report bugs efficiently before they disrupt the development cycle.\nIn this guide, we’ll explore the main components of a Jira bug workflow, how to create one, best practices to follow, common pitfalls to avoid, and how to save time and ensure maximum efficiency with Jira's planning features that support workflow management.\n‍\nWhat Is a Bug Tracking System?\nA\nbug tracking system\nis software that identifies, documents, tracks, and resolves issues throughout the development lifecycle. A dedicated\nbug tracking project\nin Jira helps organize and manage these issues. These platforms offer:\nStructured Bug Recording\n: Ensuring issues are logged consistently and designed for efficiently\ncapturing bugs\n. Issues can represent various work items, including\nproject tasks\nand\nrequest forms\n.\nEfficient Assignment\n: Helping teams swiftly delegate to the right person.\nRoot Cause Analysis\n: Providing transparency into where and why defects occur.\nPreventing Regressions\n: Ensuring resolved issues don’t resurface.\nModern bug tracking systems, like Jira, integrate seamlessly with development tools, enabling advanced features such as\nautomated notifications\n,\ncustomizable workflows\n, and\nroot cause analysis\n. Jira offers a wide range of tools and customization options to fit different project needs. By keeping all issues centralized in a backlog, you can prioritize them effectively, balance new development with bug fixes, and align with broader project objectives.\n‍\nSetting Up Your Jira Project\nSetting up a Jira project for bug tracking is the first step toward managing bugs effectively throughout your software development lifecycle. Begin by creating a new Jira project or selecting an existing project that aligns with your team’s needs. Choose a project template designed for software development or bug tracking to ensure you have the right structure in place from the start.\nNext, configure your project settings, paying special attention to the issue type screen scheme. This ensures that bug reports are categorized correctly and tracked consistently. Create custom issue types, such as “Software Bug” or “Defect,” to distinguish bugs from other project tasks. Define all the relevant fields, including severity level, description, and steps to reproduce, so that every bug report contains the information your team needs to resolve issues quickly.\nFinally, set up a custom workflow tailored to your bug tracking process. Define the statuses and transitions that reflect your team’s bug workflow, such as “Open,” “In Progress,” “Resolved,” and “Closed.” By customizing your Jira project in this way, you can manage bugs more efficiently, track their progress, and ensure that every software bug is addressed in a timely manner.\n‍\nCreating a Dedicated Bug Tracking Board\nA dedicated bug tracking board in Jira is essential for visualizing and managing the flow of bugs across your team. Start by creating a new board—either Scrum or Kanban—specifically for bug tracking. Configure the board to display only bug-related issues, allowing your team to focus on tracking and resolving bugs without distraction from other project tasks.\nOrganize the board with columns or swimlanes that represent each stage of your bug workflow, such as “To-Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.” This setup makes it easy for team members to track the progress of each bug, quickly identify bottlenecks, and spot areas where the process can be improved. Enhance your board by adding custom fields like priority or severity, giving your team additional context to help prioritize bugs and allocate resources effectively.\nBy maintaining a dedicated bug tracking board, you streamline the process of tracking bugs, ensure that nothing slips through the cracks, and empower your team members to resolve issues efficiently throughout the entire software development process.\n‍\n‍\nAdvantages of Bug Tracking Software\n1. Efficient Identification and Recording of Bugs\nBug tracking tools provide a\ncentralized platform\nfor identifying, logging, and tracking defects. This structured approach avoids duplicates, minimizes miscommunication, and ensures consistent issue tracking. For instance, Jira can integrate with error monitoring tools to automatically generate bug tickets - reducing manual steps and capturing essential data like screenshots, error logs, and severity levels.\n‍\n2. Improved Workflow Management\nDifferent bugs have different levels of impact. A minor UI glitch may not be as critical as a\nsecurity vulnerability\nor a\ncrash-inducing bug\n. Jira allows you to create custom priority levels and labels (e.g.,\nCritical\n,\nHigh\n,\nMedium\n,\nLow\n) and easily fold those into\nsprint planning\nor\nrelease cycles\n. This helps teams focus on high-impact issues first, ensuring a smooth and\nefficient workflow\n. Jira supports the entire team's workflow from bug identification to resolution, making it especially valuable for agile projects where quick prioritization and transparency are essential.\n‍\n3. Effective Bug Assignment\nQuickly assigning bugs to the relevant developer or QA engineer is crucial. With Jira’s\nautomation\nfeatures, you can create rules that automatically assign incoming bugs based on specific criteria (e.g., module owner, severity level). Assigning bugs to the right team members and the correct person ensures efficient defect tracking and resolution. This reduces administrative overhead and speeds up the resolution process.\n‍\n4. Comprehensive Backlog Overview\nHaving a detailed backlog overview is vital for maintaining control over project progress. Managing the team's backlog in Jira allows for clear prioritization of bugs and tasks, ensuring the team works on the highest priority items efficiently. Jira’s dashboards and reporting features give managers a\nholistic view\nof issues - bugs, feature requests, or improvements. This visibility ensures no bug slips through the cracks, and critical issues are tackled first. Balancing bug fixes with new features development is also streamlined, supporting agile projects and helping teams deliver value continuously.\n‍\n5. Lifecycle Tracking and Status Monitoring\nEvery bug goes through multiple statuses, from “Open” to “Closed.” Jira’s\nend-to-end visibility\nmakes sure each bug is tracked at every stage. Teams can analyze real-time progress, identify bottlenecks, and enable better collaboration by highlighting dependencies and blockers.\n‍\n6. Increased Efficiency through Automation\nAutomation in bug tracking tools significantly reduces manual tasks - such as assigning issues, sending notifications, or updating statuses - allowing teams to concentrate on\nresolving\nissues. Jira can automatically update a bug's status and send notifications in real-time as code changes and bug fixes progress, enhancing workflow efficiency. Many actions, like setting up automations or integrations, can be completed in just a couple of clicks or just a couple of minutes. Jira’s rules can also automatically generate reports, schedule updates, and notify the right people when certain triggers occur (e.g., when a bug remains unassigned for too long).\n‍\n7. Integration with Development & Collaboration Tools\nJira integrates with popular version control and CI/CD platforms (e.g.,\nGitHub\n,\nBitbucket\n,\nJenkins\n) and communication tools (e.g.,\nSlack\n,\nMicrosoft Teams\n). Developers can link bug tickets to code commits or pull requests, ensuring that context is preserved. Automatic notifications in Slack or Teams reduce context-switching and accelerate bug resolution.\n‍\n8. Detailed Documentation\nComprehensive documentation is crucial for efficient bug resolution. Jira’s\ncustom fields\nallow teams to capture extra data like impact level, related feature requests, or technical details. When bugs are well-documented, developers and QA teams spend less time on clarifications.\n‍\nJira Workflow Explained\nA\nJira workflow\ndefines a set of\nstatuses\nand\ntransitions\nthat an issue (bug, task, story) goes through from creation to completion. Depending on your project’s purpose, you can modify or create custom workflows to fit your team’s processes.\nHere are\ncommon workflow categories\nalong with typical statuses:\nBug Tracking Workflow\nCustom statuses could include:\nReported\n→\nUnder Investigation\n→\nFixed\n→\nVerified\n.\nNote that Jira’s default statuses are typically\nOpen\n,\nIn Progress\n,\nResolved\n,\nClosed\n, and\nReopened\n. You can rename or add new statuses to meet QA/testing needs.\nAgile Development Workflow\nOften includes statuses like:\nBacklog\n→\nTo Do\n→\nIn Progress\n→\nIn Review\n→\nDone\n.\nService Management Workflow\n(in Jira Service Management)\nCommonly includes statuses such as:\nWaiting for Support\n→\nWaiting for Customer\n→\nEscalated\n→\nResolved/Closed\n.\nContent Creation Workflow\nFor marketing, documentation, or content teams:\nWriting\n→\nEditing\n→\nApproved\n→\nPublished\n.\n‍\nRelating Jira Workflows to Issue Type\nIn Jira,\nworkflows are linked to issue types\nusing a\nworkflow scheme\n. A single project can have multiple workflows, and one workflow can be shared by multiple projects. While different issue types (e.g., Bugs, Tasks, Stories) can share a workflow,\neach issue type can only be associated with one workflow\nat a time. For example, a Jira bug report follows a specific workflow designed to track its progress from identification to resolution. To make your workflow active, attach it to a workflow scheme and associate that scheme with a project. Workflow schemes play a crucial role in capturing bugs efficiently by ensuring that each bug is properly tracked and managed throughout its lifecycle. You can also create custom fields for each issue type to capture specific details, automate processes, and enhance your team's ability to handle and prioritize bugs.\n‍\nHow to Track Bugs in Jira\nBelow are five primary steps to create an effective\nbug management workflow\nin Jira:\n1. Capture Bugs\nLog the defect as a Jira\nbug report\nand create a\nJira ticket\nwith\nkey details\n(description, steps to reproduce, severity, attachments). Make sure to\nreport bugs\naccurately and provide clear descriptions so\ndevelopers understand\nthe issue.\nIf you’re using\nerror monitoring tools\n, configure them to automatically create bug tickets in Jira.\nStandardize your bug templates\nusing a third-party app like\nIssue Templates for Jira Cloud\nthat lets you reuse existing issues and populate variables. This ensures every new bug ticket has consistent fields and structured data right from the start.\n‍\n2. Prioritize Bugs and Determine Impact\nAssign\npriority labels\n(High, Medium, Low) or custom fields for urgency.\nUse Jira’s filters and dashboards to monitor each bug status and measure how each defect impacts overall timelines and goals. Track how a\nbug moves\nthrough the workflow for better prioritization.\n‍\n3. Assign Related Tasks and Notify Stakeholders\nAssign bugs to the\nright team members\n, the\ncorrect person\n, or\nsoftware engineers\nresponsible for fixing the issue.\nUse Jira’s mention feature (\n@username\n) to ensure prompt collaboration.\nConfigure\nautomation rules\nto\nautomatically update\nassignments and notify watchers and stakeholders about status changes, escalations, or new comments.\n‍\n4. Identify the Source of Defects\nLink bugs to code commits or related tasks to establish a\nroot cause\n. Connect the bug to a\nnew branch\nin your version control system to track code changes related to the fix.\nUse Jira’s issue-linking feature to connect bugs to the\nrequirements or user stories\nthat caused them.\nDocument patterns or trends to reduce the chances of repeating similar issues.\n‍\n5. Check Test Coverage\nVerify that bug fixes resolve the original problem\nwithout\ncausing regressions.\nIntegrate testing tools or link a test case directly to the bug in Jira,  and involve the\nQA team\nin verification.\nUse automation or manual gating steps to ensure each bug must pass QA checks before being moved to “Resolved” or “Closed.”\n‍\nReal-Life Example\nScenario\n: Your team is building an e-commerce site. A QA engineer discovers that the “Add to Cart” button stops working under certain browser conditions.\nCapture\n: A new Jira bug ticket is created (via a standard bug template) with detailed reproduction steps, browser versions, and screenshots.\nPrioritize\n: Because the bug affects core purchasing functionality, it’s labeled\nHigh Priority\n.\nAssign\n: Jira automation assigns the issue to the right team members, ensuring the correct person - such as the software engineers who recently worked on checkout features - receives the notification\nIdentify Source\n: On investigation, the bug is tied to a recent JavaScript library update. The assigned software engineer creates a new branch in the source control system to work on the fix.\nTest Coverage\n: After the fix, QA tests across various browsers. The bug transitions from\nOpen\n→\nIn Progress\n→\nResolved\n→\nClosed\n.\n‍\nThis story-based flow shows the\nend-to-end\nuse of Jira in bug discovery, triage, resolution, and verification.\n‍\nCreating a Bug Tracking Workflow in Jira\nTo begin, you need to\ncreate project\nin Jira Software. Set up a dedicated\nbug tracking project\nto streamline your defect management process. Jira Software provides robust\nplanning features\nthat help you organize workflows, prioritize tasks, and manage the end-to-end development process. During setup, Jira offers a range of tools for workflow customization, including the ability to\ncreate custom fields\nto capture specific bug details and automate processes.\nBelow is a\nstep-by-step\nprocess to set up a Jira workflow specifically for bug tracking. Note that\nnavigation paths can differ\nbetween Jira Cloud and Jira Server/Data Center.\n‍\nStep 1: Define Your Bug Life Cycle\nIdentify the typical phases a bug goes through in your organization, focusing on the bug's status at each step and how the bug moves through the workflow. For instance:\nOpen\n: The bug's status is set to \"Open\" when it is first reported. This is the initial stage where the bug enters the tracking system.\nIn Progress\n: As the bug moves to the next phase, its status changes to \"In Progress\" when a developer starts working on it. Jira can automatically update the bug's status when work begins, reflecting real-time progress.\nResolved\n: Once the developer completes the fix, the bug's status moves to \"Resolved.\" At this point, the QA team is notified to validate the fix. Jira can automatically update the status as the bug moves from development to QA validation.\nClosed\n: After the QA team verifies the fix, the bug's status is updated to \"Closed,\" indicating no further action is needed. This transition can also be automatically updated in Jira.\nReopened\n: If the bug reappears or fails verification, the bug moves back to the \"Open\" status, restarting the cycle.\nStep 2: Create a New Workflow\nJira Cloud\n: Go to\nSettings (gear icon) > Issues > Workflows\nto access the workflow setup options that Jira offers, including planning features to help organize and manage your software development process.\nJira Server or Data Center\n: Go to\nJira Administration > Issues > Workflows\nto utilize Jira's planning features and a range of customization options.\nClick\nAdd Workflow\n, name it, and provide a description. During workflow customization, you can create custom fields to track specific bug details and enhance your team's bug tracking and prioritization.\nStep 3: Add Statuses and Transitions\nUse the workflow editor to:\nAdd the\ncustom statuses\n(e.g., “Open,” “In Progress,” “Resolved,” “Closed,” “Reopened”)  so that each bug's status is clearly defined.\nCreate transitions to define how a bug moves from one status to another throughout the workflow.\nLabel transitions clearly (e.g., “Start Work,” “Resolve Issue,” “Close Issue”).\nStep 4: Configure Conditions, Validators, and Post Functions\nConditions\n: Restrict who can transition an issue (e.g., only a QA lead or the correct person can transition from “Resolved” to “Closed”).\nValidators\n: Enforce rules (e.g., a developer must fill out the “Fix Version” field before resolving). Validators can also require that the QA team is involved in certain transitions to maintain quality standards.\nPost Functions\n: Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., notify watchers, automatically update fields or statuses, or assign the bug to QA after resolution).\nStep 5: Link Your Workflow with a Project\nCreate or Edit a Workflow Scheme\nunder\nSettings > Issues > Workflow Schemes\n(Cloud) or\nJira Administration > Issues > Workflow Schemes\n(Server/Data Center).\nAssign your\nnewly created workflow\nto the\nBug\nissue type.\nAssociate this\nworkflow scheme\nwith the desired Jira project.\n‍\nBest Practices for Bug Tracking in Jira\nEmpower Your Team with Correct Information\nJira users should use standardized bug report templates to capture essential fields (e.g., reproduction steps, environment details) and report bugs clearly so developers understand the issue. Accurate bug reporting is especially important in agile projects to ensure efficient resolution.\nQuickly Assign and Prioritize Bugs\nAutomate assignments based on severity, components, or modules.\nSet up notifications so the right person is instantly informed of new or critical bugs.\nEnsure Timely Resolution\nMap out statuses like\nOpen\n,\nIn Progress\n,\nAwaiting QA\n,\nClosed\n.\nTrack resolution time or SLA metrics to adjust your workflow if delays occur.\nAutomate Wherever Possible\nUse\nJira Automation\nto handle repetitive tasks.\nAutomatically notify stakeholders, transition statuses, or escalate overdue issues.\nIntegrate with Development Tools\nConnect Jira to version control (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket) so commits link back to bug tickets.\nUse error monitoring tools to create issues automatically with relevant data (stack traces, logs).\n‍\nCommon Pitfalls to Avoid\nForgetting to Update Statuses\nBugs can remain stuck in “Open” or “In Progress” if team members don’t actively update Jira. Use automation or regular check-ins to ensure statuses are accurate.\nOvercomplicating Workflows\nResist adding\ntoo many\nstatuses or transitions. Keep it simple and relevant to your team’s needs, or you’ll slow down your process.\nLack of Standardization\nWithout\nconsistent bug reporting\n(e.g., missing steps, no environment details), developers will spend extra time clarifying. Enforce a template to capture must-have details - this is where\nour 3rd-party app\ncan help.\nIgnoring Team-Managed vs. Company-Managed Differences\nTeam-managed projects\nhave simpler workflow configurations, while\ncompany-managed projects\nsupport more advanced workflow schemes. Pick the right project type from the start.\nNo Root Cause Documentation\nFixing the bug is good; preventing repeats is better. Document how and why each bug happened to refine processes and reduce recurring issues.\n‍\nConclusion\nCreating the\nperfect bug workflow\nin Jira is an ongoing process. It starts with identifying the statuses a bug should follow - from\nOpen\nto\nClosed\n- and establishing\nclear transitions\nand\nautomation\n. Comprehensive bug documentation reduces miscommunication and accelerates resolution, while\ntracking key metrics\nlike resolution time helps identify bottlenecks.\nBy continually refining your bug workflow,\nautomating\nrepetitive tasks, and\nintegrating\nJira with development tools, your team can maintain a streamlined process that prevents issues from slipping through the cracks. Finally, a well-designed Jira workflow boosts\nteam efficiency\n, improves software quality, and fosters a more collaborative development environment.\n‍\nPro Tip\n: Start small. Set up a basic workflow, test it with your team, and incrementally add complexity (custom statuses, automation rules, integrations) based on actual needs and feedback. This iterative approach ensures your Jira bug workflow remains both\neffective\nand\nuser-friendly\n.\nWhat if you could use templates in your daily Jira workflows?\nWe provide an easy-to-use

It often requires collaboration between Dev and IT support and that support agent-to-developer handoff is a crucial, yet easily mishandled exchange. Especially as teams strive for low\ntime-to-resolution\ntargets and happy users.\nHaving the proper tools and practices in place can help prevent bugs from becoming emergency meltdowns that significantly cost your organization. That’s why we built Jira to enable seamless collaboration across Dev, IT, and other teams. And using\nJira Service Management\n, teams can access additional dedicated features for incident and problem management.\nFirst and foremost, it’s important to create an encouraging culture around bug reporting. Eager and motivated bug reporters are more likely to keep a watchful eye and take the time to actually submit a report.\nHere are some creative tips for encouraging bug reporting:\nEstablish a bug bounty\nRewarding folks for finding software problems is a smart investment. Why hire a dedicated team when you can invest in the people building and testing the code? According to a\nstudy\nfrom the University of California Berkeley, – the “Bug Bounty” model is a major winner.\nGoogle’s\nVulnerability Reward Program\npays on a sliding scale, ranging from $100 to $20K. Ask just about anyone, anywhere, and you’ll likely find they’d be happy to do a little legwork to find a $20K bug. Google judges vulnerabilities and exploits on factors such as difficulty and impact. “Google’s average payout is $1,000, but the chance of obtaining a much higher reward appears to provide an incentive for more people to participate in its program,” the researchers wrote. Makes sense to us; people like hunting for things and winning cash for it.\nHaving the public find vulnerabilities is one thing – you can also reward internal staff for doing the same.\nSkyscanner\nhas a rewards program called “Skytrek,” which rewards staff for reporting bugs. “Everyone is encouraged to use our products all the time. If they’re an employee, they’ll see a button on our website that says ‘report feedback.’ It takes them to our\nJira Service Management\ncustomer portal where they can submit the bug,” says Michael Hall, Business Tools Team Lead. Each week, the triage team picks their Bug of The Week based on how well it is documented.\nNow that you’ve generated some buzz around bug reporting, there are several key considerations to make bug tracking as easy as possible. It’s important to consider both sides of bug-tracking: streamline the way for users to submit the report and record the right information, and empower the responders who receive notifications to resolve the bug.\nUse these best practices to track and squash pesky bugs.\n1. Create a central place for users to submit bug reports\nHaving a help center gives users a central location for reporting bugs, and submitting other kinds of service requests. The help center is like the display window in a storefront: it welcomes visitors and can guide them to resources and the lead them to take the best next steps. It should be the top-of-mind place to alert your team to any potential problems.\nA help center outfitted with specific request types guides users to accurate reporting. In Jira Service Management, request types can be configured to suit the needs of your team. Agents can set up bug reporting request types and organize them in ways that make it easier for users to access the information they need. Agents can also build dynamic forms to enable thorough and accurate reporting, helping them collect all the information they need to fix a bug quickly. These customizations streamline the bug-reporting process by minimizing back-and-forth and time spent searching for the right forms.\n2. Allow multiple reporting channels\nOne of the first steps in bug tracking starts with the user who first reports the problem. As the front line of any service, the customer can be a great source of information about any emerging bugs. This means it’s even more important to ensure your bug reporting system is a positive, frictionless, easy-to-use experience. Providing the customer with multiple reporting mechanisms gives them the flexibility to easily alert your team to a potential bug and gives your team the opportunity to avoid an incident. Jira Service Management can collect reports from multiple reporting channels, including email, chat and an\nembeddable widget\nin addition to the Help Center.\n3. Automate where you can\nTask automation is meant to save your team time and increase productivity, allowing your team to provide the best service possible. Picking what task, how deeply you want to automate it, and enacting the automation beforehand can help you eliminate any bottlenecks.\nFor example, teams can group tickets referring to similar bugs, and then the reported bug can be linked to existing development work. From here, the bug issues can be escalated. Subsequently, each linked reporter will be automatically notified that their issue has been addressed and is in the process of resolution. This way, no extra work is necessary on the responding end and users are kept informed on the status of their report.\nTeams can use Jira Service Management’s automation templates, or tailor rules to their preference. Organizations can automatically assign Jira issues for distributed teams, auto-assign approvers, link related support issues (like multiple users reporting the same bug), and more. With automated notifications and alerts configured in your workflows and templates, responders avoid miscommunication and connect with the right teams to resolve bugs collaboratively (and quickly). Hundreds of automation rule templates are at your fingertips and can be tweaked and edited to suit your team’s specific needs.\nBrowse our\nautomation template library\nfor Jira Service Management.\n4. Unite Dev and IT support\nYou may have heard the phrase, “\nyou built it, you run it\n.” This statement refers to the responsibility of developers remain connected to day-to-day operations of their software, knocking down the wall between the builders and those who manage the support between the software and the customer. This forges a more direct connection between the developers and users, creating a stronger feedback loop, that can enhance the customer experience.\nIn order to effectively track and attack bugs, it's imperative that teams emphasize preparation as the first and foremost element to any response plan. This means uniting your development and IT support teams to collaboratively monitor and respond to bug reports. By bringing these teams together, it becomes everyone’s responsibility to ensure software is running smoothly.\nDespite the obvious benefits — less pressure on IT support teams, production-ready design, quicker response times, and more thoroughly tested code — some teams are not as\nunited\nas they could be. A strong bug-squashing practice requires united teams, empowered to collaborate through culture and tools.\nWhen bugs pop up (and they will), service teams can seamlessly link Jira Service Management issues to the Jira Software development backlog. Developers can jump in and view comments and give feedback. Everyone has access to the same context so you can maintain a seamless experience across bug reporters, agents, and developers.\nStrong bug tracking practices and tools can help teams avoid downtime, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce incidents. Squash bugs by encouraging bug reporting, automating the process whenever possible, and enabling stronger collaboration across dev and IT teams. With a united front, those bugs don’t stand a chance!\nDiscover the benefits of Jira Service Management’s bug-tracking capabilities.\nTry Jira Service Management free\nTutorial\nLearn incident communication with Statuspage\nIn this tutorial, we’ll show you how to use incident templates to communicate effectively during outages.

For example, you may want to show an issue's Resolution, Priority,\nLabels, Security Level, etc.\nOn this page:\nFor all of the following procedures, you must be logged in as a user with the\nJira admin\nor a\nboard admin\npermissions. For details, see\nPermissions overview\n.\nHere’s\nwhat\nthe full issue view looks like (if you open\nthe issue by selecting its key; in this example, TIHP-16).\nAnd here’s what the issue details view looks like (if you open the issue\nfrom the backlog or board):\nYou can configure the fields in the issue details view from two places:\nBoard configuration\nProject configuration\nLet’s see what you can do\nthere and how your changes will impact the\nlayout of the\nissue view\n.\nBoard configuration\nUse the board configuration to:\nadd more fields to the issue details view\nchange the positions of fields\nhide some fields from the issue details view\nadd fields to\nissues on all boards in your project.\nTo view the fields when opening issues\non the boards, y\nou’ll need to add\nthe\nfields\nthrough the\nboard configurations\nfor each board.\nNote that the fields you add to the issue details view through the board configurations won’t be editable.\nThe following sections include instructions on how to play with the fields in this list, as well as how to make them editable.\nAdding, moving, or deleting a field\nGo to the desired board and select\nBoard\n>\nConfigure\n.\nIn the left-side menu, select\nIssue Detail View\n.\nYou’ll see different groups of fields: General\nfields, Date fields, People, and Links.\nThe fields that you can see in these groups\nmake up\nthe issue view.\nTo add a new field, select the field from one of the\ndropdown menus, and then s\nelect\nAdd.\nIf you want to hide a field from the issue\ndetails\nview,\nselect\nDelete\n.\nTo change the\nposition of the field\nin the issue\ndetails\nview\n, use the vertical grid\nicon\nto\ndrag and drop\nthe\nfield up or down i\nn the list\n.\nThe\nBug Count\nfield will be added to the issue\ndetails\nview, but the field\nwon’t be editable until you\nadd it to the\nappropriate issue screen\n.\nYou'll see\nthe added field\nonly if you open the issue on the board or from the backlog. To view the field in the full issue view, you\nneed to associate that field with the relevant issue type and make sure that the field isn't hidden.\nFor details, check the following articles:\nSpecifying field behavior\nfor built-in fields\nAdding custom fields\nfor custom fields\nStorypoints vs Original Storypoints fields\nThere’s one important thing you should know about the\nStory points\nfield and how it’s different from the\nOriginal story points\nfield.\nYou can add the\nStory points\nfield only through the Screens configuration. You’ll see this field with its original name\nStory points\nin the full issue view. Also, if you open the issue on the board, you'll see the\nEstimate\nfield that is the same as\nStory points\n. The behavior of the\nEstimate\nfield depends on the\nestimation configuration\non the board:\nIf the estimation configuration is set to story points, the\nEstimate\nfield in the issue view will contain a numeric value indicating the number of set story points.\nIf the estimation configuration is set to original time estimate or original story points, the\nEstimate\nfield will contain the value\nUnestimated\n.\nIf the estimation configuration is set to issue count, you won't see the\nEstimate\nfield in the issue view on the board.\nThe\nOriginal story points\nfield can be added both through the board configuration and the Screens configuration. So, you can manage this field in the same way as the\nSprint\nfield in the above example.\nWhy is it so and what’s the difference between these concepts?\nThis is the Jira way: you can add the\nStory points\nfield to the issue view only by adding it to the issue screen schemes.\nThe difference between story points and original story points is the following: if you're using story points as the estimation unit in your project, you can use original story points as initial, rough estimates of the work you’re planning to do.\nThen, you can use original story points as references when you start breaking down and providing more detailed estimates for your work. So, you can compare the accuracy of the original estimates against the actual ones.\nLearn more about how to estimate an issue\nProject configuration\nYour project configuration includes the configurations for\nissue screens\nthat you should use to make the fields in the issue view editable if they were added through the board configurations.\nAny field, which you add by following these instructions, will be available and editable in the full issue view. However, the field won't appear on the issue open on the board or from the backlog until you add that field through the\nboard configuration\n.\nTo open to the issue screen configurations:\nIn the upper-right corner of the screen, select\nAdministration\n>\nProjects\n.\nSelect the project where you’re customizing the view of issues.\nSelect\nScreens\n.\nHere you’ll find the\nscreen schemes\nfor each issue type you have in the project.\nClick on the scheme name to expand the details and\nmake changes to the issue view.\nMaking the added field editable in the issue view\nTo make the field editable, you should add it to the View Issue Screen with the help of the corresponding screen scheme:\nOpen the screen scheme for the\nView\nIssue\noperation. If all operations use the same screen scheme, your changes will be duplicated for the other operations.\nScroll down the list of fields in this scheme. You’ll see the dropdown menu where you can find the field that you want to add and make editable.\nSelect\nAdd\n.\nOpen\nthe issue\n. You’ll see that the\nBug Count\nfield is now editable.\nSome fields may not appear\nin the issue view\ni\nmmediately after you add them\nthrough\nthe\nS\ncreen\ns\nconfiguration as they are required to have\nparticular values\n. After you edit the issue and update the field's value, the field will appear in the full issue view.\nNext steps\nNeed help?\nIf you can't find the answer you're looking for in our documentation, we have other resources available to help you.

Team members monitor technical defects found in the program and the process of fixing them. Jira software is most\noften used for this purpose. It is a powerful bug-tracking tool that is also suitable for project and task management. We will discuss the nuances of working with it in this article. This article will discuss the essence of bug-tracking and the nuances of working with this system.\nTable of contents\nWhat is bug tracking?\nA bug is an error that occurs during the code-writing phase or while working with a software product. However, it is not a bug but rather an unexpected behavior of the product or the result of such behavior.\nBugs often occur due to unpredictable user actions, such as incorrect data entry. You should understand that they can have serious consequences for the project. That is why the team must constantly monitor them and promptly fix them.\nVarious tools are used to systematically register and manage bugs. They allow you to create tickets with bug descriptions, set priorities, assign tickets to performers, generate reports, and visualize the stages of work.\nAmong such tools, we can distinguish Trello, Axosoft, Backlog, ReQtest, MantisBT, Bugzilla, and BugHerd. However, the most famous bug tracker (and, simultaneously, a project\nmanagement\nsystem) is undoubtedly Jira. Teams often prefer Jira issue tracker due to its comprehensive features for tracking, prioritizing, and resolving bugs effectively.\nWhat Is Jira Tool?\nThis is the famous bug-tracking system from Atlassian. It saw the light of day back in 2002. It is noteworthy that, at first, it was only about software development. But later,\nJira\nbecame an important tool for optimizing work with projects, tasks, and bugs. This is what modern IT teams use it for.\nThe main component of the bug-tracking tool is a database of all bugs found:\na user who reported the error;\ndate and time when the error was detected;\nerror severity;\ndescription of the program behavior;\na user responsible for fixing the error;\nthe current state of the error.\nMembers of the development team can view and edit errors.\nJira\nadmin, for example, the project manager sets permissions based on the current error state, moves them to other states, and deletes them if necessary.\nJira\nsoftware allows users to report bugs, examine detailed information, and raise appropriate issues. This creates an optimal environment for solving problems that arise during the development process and monitoring the team’s overall progress.\nHow does Jira work?\nTo understand the details, let’s look at the main points of work related to projects and issues of one type or another. Jira issue can be called the key element of the whole system.\nTo begin with, the system has different project templates:\nKanban.\nKanban boards place issues according to their status. The limit-setting tool helps to prevent multiple projects from running simultaneously.\nScrum.\nScrum board allows you to plan your workflow by sprints. You can study the project roadmap, put issues in the backlog, and monitor progress within each sprint.\nNote:\nThe Scrum and Kanban board templates have a similar workflow (Done, In Progress, To Do) and issue types (epic, story, bug, task, sub-task). A whole team or company (administrators) can manage such projects.\nBug tracking. If there is a need to quickly find and fix errors, it is worth creating a new project using this template. The template is designed to effectively utilize the Jira issue tracker for managing and resolving bugs. It has a broader structure: an additional column In progress and issues improvement, and a new function.\nThe interface workspace displays boards with columns and issues that can move between columns depending on status.\nAs we mentioned above, the system has several types of Jira issues. Here are the main ones:\nEpic:\nthe Jira project’s major issue, divided into sprints.\nStory:\npart of an epic that is solved in one sprint.\nTask:\npart of the work of one or more team members.\nSub-task:\npart of a task.\nBug:\nany defect found in a program.\nThus, an epic is divided into a story and a tusk. User stories and tasks can include sub-tasks. There is also an enhancement request to describe changes in functionality or a new feature. The test case type becomes available after integrating the system with plugins. The question type deals with end-user questions, e.g., regarding functionality.\nA bug is a special Jira issue, thanks to which you can perform bug fixing promptly. In the following, we will go into more detail about the features in the area of tracking bugs.\nKey Features of Jira Bug Tracking Tool\nWe have highlighted some of the most important features that underlie the bug-tracking tool.\nCreating issues\nYou can add an issue to a project in minutes. To do this, just click the Create issue button in the top menu of the Jira page, select the appropriate Project, and set Bug as the type.\nBug reports\nTo make a detailed bug report in Jira software, you should fill in the following fields:\nSummary:\na concise description of the essence of the bug.\nDescription\n: all the relevant details in a convenient format.\nPriority:\nthe severity of the bug.\nAssignee:\nthe user who will work on the issue.\nLabels:\ncharacter traits.\nReporter:\nthe issue creator and the one doing the work.\nAttachment:\ndocuments, illustrations, and other materials.\nLinked Issues:\nwork that depends on this issue being done.\nThe fields\nProject*\n,\nType*\n, and\nSummary*\nare required. The rest of the information is added to reveal the essence of the Jira bugs and to plan the team’s workflow.\nBug Life Cycle\nA bug goes through several stages from the beginning of its existence until it is completely fixed. Among the main statuses: Open, In progress, Reopened, Resolved, Closed.\nLet’s look at an example of what a bug-tracking project might look like:\nSuppose you found a bug, registered it in the system, and specified the performer (developer). The bug gets open status.\nWhen the performer fixed the bug, they mark you for verification through Assign to, and the issue remains open.\nYou check for the fix, and if it’s correct, you close it. If not, you pass it back to the developer, meaning the issue remains open.\nAll this is repeated as often as necessary to close a particular issue. The process can be even simpler: you find a bug, assign a developer who immediately fixes it, and closes it. But here, you lose such an important step as verification.\nNew people are added to the process as needed. For example, test manager, analyst, senior and junior software engineers participate in bug tracking.\nCollaboration with the devs\nEverything that happens during Jira bug tracking is recorded in the activity log. This includes Jira issues and their updates, assignment, and comments from development team members. This gives you a reliable and convenient space to gather feedback and exchange relevant details about a bug directly.\nLinking the defect\nYou can select this option during the creation phase of a Jira issue. The point is to define the relationship between the tasks. For example, relates to, is blocked by, is cloned by, is duplicated by, is caused by. Using simple and clear words makes issue tracking easier.\nImport and export defects\nIf you want to create issues in bulk in a Jira project, use the CSV import function. To share data with other users (especially non-Jira users), save the document in XML, Word, or Printable format.\nDifferent types of reports\nJira software offers visual bug reports for more efficient analysis. These are Average Age Report, Created vs. Resolved Issues Report, Recently Created Issues Report, Time Since Issues Report, and many others. You can see newly created issues and completed work.\nNext, let’s look at the features of bug tracking at different stages of the Jira workflow.\nFive Main Stages of Jira Workflow to Handle Bugs\n#1: Reporting bugs\nThe first step is to create a Jira bug report. You should create an issue and go through all the steps described above. Select a bug from the list of issue types, describe the issue details, and add additional material. Remember that the report should be structured and understandable for all members of the QA team, including non-technical experts.\n#2: Prioritizing Bugs\nNow assess the priority to perform the assigning correctly. It makes sense that urgent problems should be put first and minor ones when there are enough resources.\nSet your priorities right:\nDoes it take little effort to fix the bug? Put it in the front rows to execute as soon as possible.\nIs the bug critical or blockers? Add it to the actual sprint and evaluate it with story points.\nIs it a major or minor issue? Group them by component and add them to feature development.\nWhat if it’s a trivial issue? Solving it during work or making it part of the technical debt is better.\nThe team must devote maximum time and attention to issues with high and the highest priority. In the first case, these bugs negatively affect the main functions and users. In the second, they are bugs that barely affect users but create serious problems.\n#3: Identifying the cause of a bug\nNow you can assign the ticket and start working on the bug. The main thing is to understand the root cause of a Jira bug. Correct identification allows you to resolve bugs faster and reduce the risk of them recurring. The TDD approach is optimal. Its essence: write a test and prove it doesn’t work, then make changes and prove otherwise.\n#4: Test coverage\nCode changes can seriously affect the software product. Using feature requests to improve the product or support a specific use case makes sense. After fixing the Jira bug, think about how to prevent similar problems. It may be necessary to revise the process and adapt support and documentation.\n#5: Closing the issue\nTo close the issue, make sure that the bug is completely fixed and will not happen again in the future. Also, search for similar problems in the product and fix them beforehand. The support processes and documentation should be modified accordingly.\nIf you correctly identify the cause of the problem, the fix will be successful. Otherwise, the bug can appear again. This means that it will be necessary to reopen the issue and start the resolving bugs process again.\nDo you want to save time and track bugs as efficiently as possible? Then it makes sense to make a custom workflow in Jira.\nPersonalization Jira Workflows for Efficiency\nSet bug tracking project\nTo begin, log in to your company’s workspace and follow the following chain of actions:\nProjects → Create Project.\nProject Templates → Software Development → Bug Tracking → Use Template → Name → Key.\nCreate Project. Done!\nPrepare custom workflows\nClick on Project settings → Workflows → Actions. Create the statuses you need for this particular project. Examples of simple steps: To do, Assigned, In progress, Done. Now you can set your status for all issues.\nCreate Kanban board\nTo simplify issue tracking, use Kanban’s handy visual format. To do this:\nClick on Boards → Create board.\nChoose Kanban → Board from an existing project.\nConsider a name for your new board and choose the project you want to link it to.\nThis will allow you to prioritize bugs, edit issues and add use cases in two clicks.\nAdd custom issue types\nConsider how to do this in 10 steps:\nGot to Global Settings → Issues → Add Issue Type.\nCreate a new issue type to suit your purposes.\nSelect your project in the Issue Type Scheme and then Edit.\nMove the created issue type into your schema.\nGo to Screen settings → Add Screen.\nSelect specific fields (the main ones are Summary and Description).\nClick on Screen Schemes → Add Screen Schemes.\nCreate a new scheme and link it to your Screen.\nGo to Issue Type Screen Scheme → the corresponding project → Associate an issue type with a screen scheme.\nSelect the created issue type and Screen Scheme and add them.\nCreate system to prioritize bugs\nTo determine the severity of new issues, use your priorities. The simplest option, which the whole team can understand: Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lowest. If necessary, you can add custom fields to expand the list of options.\nTo ensure the effectiveness of highly customizable Jira bug tracking, you need to maintain continuous communication in the system.\nTeam Communication and Notification Clients\nAt the heart of communication is a well-written report. It should be both concise and informative. Fill out all the fields: from the title and descriptor to the console logs and environment. Attach a screenshot and visual proof. Comment chains are provided for team discussion and adding other details.\nWhat about communication with the client? After closing the issue, you must notify them about it. Use the agreed channels of communication. As a rule, these are emails. Be sure to include the issue number, title, and screenshot taken before the bug was resolved. This is especially important if your client does not use Jira software.\nJira software is a valuable tool for achieving bug-tracking goals. There are many reasons for that. It is easy to use, even for non-technical people, and has everything you need for teamwork.\nMoreover, you can customize it to your needs and integrate it with TMS Testomat.io in a few clicks for\nproductive test management.\n📋 Test management system for Automated tests\nManage automation testing along with manual testing in one workspace.\nTry it for free\nagile\njira\nFollow us\nYou can know more\nLatest Articles\nInsights\nroi test managment\ntest management\nThe ROI of Test Data Management: Quantifying the Value of Better Test Data Practices\nSoftware development teams waste 30-50% of their time setting up test environments instead of actually testing.

Jira offers so many different ways to manage issues that you may even feel a bit overwhelmed by the choices. Depending on your needs, you may be perfectly fine with a simple Kanban board or gallop through the\ntasks\nlike a pro using advanced search queries. To help wrap your head around Jira issue tracking and find the most suitable tool for you, in this article we’ll share 4 proven ways to monitor projects at different levels of context – from the bird’s eye view to the details of a single task.\nTable of contents\nWhy issue tracking in Jira is the key to success?\nHow to filter and manage Jira issues?\n1. The pro way: Issue Navigator\n2. The agile way: Jira boards\n3.  The timely way: Jira queues\nHow to  use  Jira effectively?\nWhy issue tracking in Jira is the key to success?\nBeing aware of everything going on in a project will not just tell you what needs to be done and when. It will also help you plan ahead by staying informed of possible problems and risks. Jira issues, with all the different fields and details, offer plenty of insights into your customers’ needs and let you keep track of your to-do list better than any other tool out there.\nContext is extremely important for every Jira issue. Your role, project type, customer request type, status, and available information will determine your current needs and the next steps. The best way to illustrate this is through examples. That’s why to every method for tracking issues, we’ll add who can use it and what for. We’ll in more detail focus on two characters – a product owner and a Jira Service Management agent.\nImagine you’re a product owner of a popular application who’s reviewing the progress of a recently started sprint. You want to check the project’s health, find unassigned and blocked issues, and plan the upcoming release of a new version. It’s important for you to have all the information – what’s the status, what problems occurred, and how they can be solved to help achieve your goal.\nOr, you are a Jira Service Management agent who’s just received a report from a customer. It refers to a known issue that could’ve been reported earlier. You want to keep the\nSLAs\no\nn\ntime and quickly find out whether a similar problem has been resolved before and how. You’re in a hurry and want to learn as much as you can in the shortest possible time because the customer is waiting.\nHow to filter and manage Jira issues?\nJira is not a one-size-fits-all platform. It offers different views depending on the configuration. Some of them, like boards, are limited to selected projects. The others, including the Issue Navigator and filters, can be used site-wide and customized to fit the most specific needs. What to choose?\n1. The pro way: Issue Navigator\nThe Issue Navigator\ncan be accessed in many different ways in Jira. The easiest one is probably through global search in the top right corner of your screen. Click the search field and hit Enter to be redirected to\nthe advanced Jira search interface called the Issue Navigator.\nOnce there, some people may feel overwhelmed as the Issue Navigator offers plenty of options. Even though it has a basic, more user-friendly mode, it requires you to do a lot of clicking before displaying relevant search results. To take full advantage of the Navigator, you should be proficient in JQL,\nJira’s\nvery own query language\n, and be familiar with different conditions and operators. In return,\nyou get full control over your search and can make it as specific as needed by adding new fields and query combinations\n. You can preview issues straight from the search results, export and download the list as a spreadsheet file.\nThe Issue Navigator is a powerful search tool but not a very fast one as it tends to load slowly and often interrupts your workflow by forcing you to leave the issue preview or jump between browser tabs.\nWho is it good for:\nadvanced Jira users, project administrators, and managers who can afford to spend some time tweaking the search criteria and browsing the results.\nHow our characters can use it:\nboth the product owner and Service Management agent can set the search parameters and select their values from the list (for example the parameter is\nIssue type\nand the value is\nEpic\n), or write a query in JQL.\nLearn more\nJira Issue Navigator Handbook: Search, Sort & Customize Your Issues (2024 Edition)\nJira 101: Mastering the Jira create new epic process [Step-by-step tutorial]\n2. The agile way: Jira boards\nBoards are the core of every Jira Software project. They provide you with a visual overview of everything that’s going on at the moment in a project. There are two different types of boards designed for agile and DevOps teams.\nDepending\non your team’s methodology and needs, you may use\nthe\nScrum\nor\nKanban boards\n. The Scrum board lets you set up the\nproduct backlog\n, create and complete tasks in work periods called sprints. The Kanban board is simpler and more intuitive as it consists of columns and basic statuses to limit Work in Progress and maximize team efficiency.\nDue to displaying tasks in columns and statuses, the boards let you easily see what your teammates currently work on, what’s on hold, and what’s waiting in the queue. Both Scrum and Kanban boards are vital to every Jira project. They can span across different projects, letting you view and manage tasks of many different teams in one place. However, they don’t offer too many customization options. You can only filter by basic fields (e.g. Epic) and create columns based on the workflow defined by the project administrator.\nFrom the management perspective, boards offer an overview of all active tasks but only at a limited scope and within a specified timeframe, f.e. a single sprint. Their main purpose is to give you a general idea of what’s happening in the project, track the progress, and take action if needed.\nWho is it good for:\nthe project administrators and product owners who want to stay on track at all times, as well as individuals hoping to better organize their work and personal time.\nHow our characters can use it:\nthe product owners can use the Scrum board to build the backlog and plan the future of their products in a timely, controlled manner. Although the boards are mainly dedicated to the Software project, the Service Management agents can use them to organize work in their teams.\n3.\nThe timely way: Jira queues\nTechnically speaking, tickets created by customers in the Customer Portal aren’t different from Jira issues. While in Jira Software we use boards to manage issues,\nService Management agents keep track of ongoing requests with queues\n.\nIntegrated into Service Management projects, queues can be customized to filter tickets that meet specific criteria. For example, Service Management teams can have active queues for all opened requests, critical bugs in a selected product, or tickets with SLA in danger of a breach.\nThe Service Management agents can easily switch between filters and view issues as a list. The interface is similar to the Issue Navigator and almost as powerful. Filters can be changed, updated, and shared with other team members to keep everyone in the loop. Search criteria can be field- or JQL-based, meaning that you can add some very specific criteria and display issues from different projects, products, and Customer Portals.\nThe downside is that queues are only available in Service Management projects. No matter what you type in JQL, the JSM project is predefined, so you’ll get the results only from it. However, w\nith\nour\nQueues for Jira Service Management\napp, it’s possible to have a queue with the tickets coming from multiple projects of different types. The same as the native queues, our app is based on JQL, but the difference is that you can display everything you want.\nThen in one queue, you can see the service desk tickets and issues from business and software projects\n.\nConsidering the fact that our app doesn’t have any restrictions regarding the project types, it looks like the Issue Navigator moved to the queue. Now let’s take a look at our support team queue.\nIn the\nEscalations\nqueue\n, the agents can see which tickets have to be handled first. In the\nTo handle\nqueue, there are the tickets waiting for support. Another queue,\nReady to close\n, gathers all the tickets already fixed by the developers. This way the support agents know they need to inform the customers that the features they were waiting for are ready. The support agents can also see the development teams’ queues gathered in 4 categories. When they unfold\none of them\n(\nAll Stars\n,\nCloud Apps\n,\nRTM Team\n, and\nJSD Team\non our screen), they see:\nNew features\nqueue with the tickets waiting for the product owner’s analysis;\nDev analyzing\nqueue with the tickets waiting for the developers’ analysis.\nOnce the tickets are analyzed by the product owners or developers, they come back to the support team’s queue. Then the agents inform the customers what will be the next steps regarding their requests.\nWho is it good for:\neveryone who wants to improve their daily work. The availability for every project type and the queue based on JQL make this app easy to match with the needs of every team.\nHow our characters can use it:\nthe support agent can\nsmoothly cooperate with the product owners or developers\n. The apps let them be always up to date with the statuses of the customers’ requests and the actions that the other teams perform regarding them. The agents can also create and share with their teammates a custom filter with issues from the same reporter or organization. The product owners can not only see the support ticket waiting for their analysis but also every type of issue they need to follow in their work.\nCreate cross-project queues in Jira Service Management\nEasily collaborate with product owners, stay updated on request statuses, share custom filters, and let product owners view all relevant requests using Queues for Jira & JSM app.\nTry it free\nHow to\nuse\nJira effectively?\nSearching and managing issues in\nJira ticketing system\ncan take up a lot of time that you’d probably like to spend on your actual work.

Our platform tracks every\nreported outage, performance issue, and maintenance window to ensure\nyou're informed. Whether Jira Software is experiencing a problem now or\nhas recently resolved one, our detailed history keeps you updated.\nMore than 600\nStatusGator users monitor Jira Software\nto get notified when it's down, is under maintenance,\nor has an outage.\nThis makes it\none of the most popular Project Management services\nmonitored on our platform.\nWe've sent more than 48,800 notifications to our users\nabout Jira Software incidents, providing transparency and peace of mind.\nYou can get alerts by\nsigning up\nfor a free StatusGator account.\nEarly Warning Signals\nIf we detect a potential Jira Software outage or other issue\nbefore it was reported on the official status page\nwe will send an Early Warning Signal notification to StatusGator subscribers.\nWe can often detect issues before they are officially acknowledged by the\nprovider, giving you a head start on resolving any potential problems.\nDown Notifications\nIf Jira Software is having system outages or experiencing other\ncritical issues, red\ndown\nnotifications appear on the status page.  In\nmost cases, it means that core functions are not working properly, or\nthere is some other serious customer-impacting event underway.\nWarning Notifications\nWarn\nnotifications are used when Jira Software is undergoing a\nnon-critical issue like minor service issues, performance degradation,\nnon-core bugs, capacity issues, or problems affecting a small number of\nusers.\nMaintenance Notifications\nJira Software posts separate notifications for planned maintenance\nwork. StatusGator will notify subscribers when Jira Software enters a\npre-planned maintenance window, keeping you up to date.\nStatus Messages\nWhen Jira Software posts issues on their status page, we collect the\nmain headline message and include that brief information or overview in\nnotifications to StatusGator subscribers.\nStatus Details\nWhen Jira Software has outages or other service-impacting events on\ntheir status page, we pull down the detailed informational updates and\ninclude them in notifications. These messages often include the current\ndetails about how the problem is being mitigated, or when the next update\nwill occur.\nComponent Status Filtering\nBecause Jira Software has several components, each with their\nindividual statuses, StatusGator can differentiate the status of each\ncomponent in our notifications to you whenever a particular component is down.

inaccessible due to outages or maintenance issues with the Atlassian platform. Customers can check the Atlassian Status Page and community forums for updates.","raw_content":"Is Jira down? What to do when Jira isn’t working\nJira is an established favorite among agile project management and software development professionals. Developed by Atlassian, Jira is used and loved by thousands of customers worldwide, including digital trailblazers like Spotify, eBay, and Airbnb. It’s available as an online service (a SaaS product) and on-premises software.\nUnfortunately, even the best, most stable platforms have their limitations. And when Jira is down, project managers’ and developers’ heart rates quickly start to rise! If that’s ever happened to you, you’ll understand the level of frustration a Jira outage can cause, and you’re not alone.\nThere’s a variety of reasons Jira might be down today. It could be a platform error or outage that’s out of your hands. It could be an innocent mistake on your part or a local system or infrastructure-related issue. Most of these scenarios are fixable or undoable – if you have a reliable\nbackup and recovery solution for your Jira data.\nIn this post, we’ll take a 360-degree view of some of the most commonly reported issues with Jira, why they occur, and the steps you can take to get back up and running as quickly as possible.\nWhat is Jira, and why use it?\nInitially created as a handy tool to find and root out pesky bugs and issues, Jira has metamorphosed into a potent and dynamic work management tool. Today, project managers and software developers rely on it to track and manage their software projects (Jira supports any agile methodology, including scrum, kanban, or bespoke options.)\nBy deploying Jira, you can rest assured that everyone is productive and focused on top priorities and that project tasks get completed speedily, on time, and on budget.\nBecause Jira is super-easy to learn and use, in recent years, it’s attracted the attention of non-IT users such as portfolio managers, general product managers and owners, and marketing teams. In particular, they gravitate towards Jira Work Management (JWM) to help them accelerate and optimize business projects.\nIs Jira down today? Common causes and what to do about them\nThe more we rely on our digital tools, the more devastating being unable to access them becomes. We want answers – fast!\nLet’s explore some of the most common reasons why Jira Cloud isn’t working:\n1. The Jira platform (hosted by Atlassian) is having issues\nIf you try to log into Jira and find that it’s down or unavailable, it could be because the Atlassian platform is experiencing a glitch. This could be related to temporary maintenance or a more complicated issue on their part.\nFor example, in April 2022, an\nongoing outage\naffected numerous Atlassian customers, causing their Jira and Confluence instances to be inaccessible. When customers attempted to access their Jira instances, they were shown an error that the page was unavailable or under maintenance.\nThe ideal first port of call to establish if Jira Cloud is down is the\nAtlassian Status Page\n. Here, you’ll find status information for each of Atlassian’s products and services.\nIf it’s a universal problem, you’ll probably also find reports from other users in the\nAtlassian Jira Community\n.\nAlso, log into\nDowndetector\n, which offers a graphical view of problem reports submitted in the past 24 hours compared to the typical volume of reports by the time of day.\nIsDown\nis another useful downtime reporting resource to check out.\nAs a service provider renowned for customer service excellence, Atlassian will likely send you an email alert regarding such issues and make a public statement regarding the cause. In the case of the abovementioned outage, Atlassian\nsaid\nthat a routine maintenance script disabled a small number of sites:\n“While conducting a routine maintenance script, a small number of sites were unintentionally disabled, which resulted in them being unable to access their products and data. We know our customers rely on our products to get their work done, and we are sorry for the disruption this has caused. We are working 24/7 to restore products to full availability. Affected customers can reach out to us at https://support.atlassian.com/contact if they have any questions.”\nWhile Atlassian strives to maintain acceptable levels of uptime within their Terms of Service, they have\nno responsibility for securing account-level data\n. Learn more about how the\nShared Responsibility Model\naffects your data security responsibilities.\n2. Jira isn’t working … but the problem is closer to home\nIf you consult the above resources and find that you’re the only one experiencing problems with Jira, you likely have an issue with your local infrastructure, systems, or user activity.\nHere are some common scenarios:\nAccidental deletion\nIf you’ve recently updated your Jira database, you might have accidentally deleted a file or code that your Jira instance depends on to function.\nIf this happens, you’ll need to restore from a backup and start the process from scratch.\nFailed CSV uploads\nIt’s not unusual for errors like corrupted files, column-naming discrepancies, or code mistakes to occur when you do bulk uploads from a CSV file.\nIn such cases, the file could shut everything else down.\nIt’s a sensible idea to run a backup before uploading any CSV files. If the worst happens, and you have a comprehensive backup in place, you can restore your instance in a few clicks.\nIncompatible third-party apps and plugins\nThird-party apps and plugins are great, but they and Jira don’t always play well together. Incompatibility issues could arise, causing your Jira instance to malfunction or fail.\nSpecifically, plugins can consume the database connection pool (often called DBCP) and memory (heap usage) and slow down issue operations. Start by disabling plugins and see if you still experience performance problems. You can do this by enabling Safe Mode in the Universal Plugin Manager (UPM) to verify whether or not a plugin is a problem. Bear in mind that this will likely reduce your instance’s functionality.\nNote: Atlassian does\nnot\nprovide support for third-party plugins. If you’re still experiencing problems, visit the Atlassian Marketplace to find the plugin developer’s details and contact them directly, or raise a question on Atlassian Answers to appeal for help from the Atlassian community.\nWhile investigating potential plugin issues, you can stay productive by restoring your Jira instance from a reliable backup.\n3. Performance issues\nPerformance issues\nin Jira are multi-faced and might include the following:\nBrowser-related problems\nThe source of your woes could be as simple as your browser experiencing a temporary performance problem. Try using a different browser to see if there’s any difference in response times. If the problem persists across browsers, it likely points to client-side, server-side performance.\nFor further assistance diagnosing problems, take a look through Atlassian’s\nTroubleshooting Client-Side Browser Problems\n.\nAt-capacity, overused instance, or other server issues\nThere are various possible root causes for server issues, and they often depend on your database stats (issues, custom fields, workflows, users, and security schemes) and your Jira application version.\nSend a\nSupport ZIP\nto Atlassian Support, and they’ll provide you with some basic recommendations. You may need to perform a server upgrade if the instance is too large for your version.\nAnalyzing your access logs with the\nJira HTTP Requests Log Analyzer\nis a quick way to diagnose if your instance is overloaded.\nDisk speed\nPoor disk I/O can result in poor performance associated with searches, gadgets, and 10+ attachments. If you suspect this might be your problem, test your disk speed with the utility and instructions from Atlassian’s\nTesting Disk Access Speed\ntool and compare your results with the good/bad/average ranges.\nWhatever the performance issue, a backup solution will allow you to troubleshoot without losing hours or even days of productivity.\nJira backup options\nAs we’ve explored, most Jira issues will pass (once the Atlassian platform is restored) or can be easily mitigated (once you troubleshoot local hardware, system, or application issues.)\nBut, the fastest and most reliable method of ensuring your Jira data is available is an in-house backup and recovery process. Let’s look at your options for backing up and restoring your Jira cloud:\nJira Backup Manager\nJira’s Backup Manager is Atlassian’s backup solution for Jira. It supports manual exports as frequently as every 24 hours. Backup coverage includes pages, users, and attachments. However, storage for backup snapshots is your responsibility. You must save and version these in your own environment at your own expense.\nYou can perform backup using automation scripts, but you’ll need to invest engineering time to develop and maintain them as Atlassian doesn’t provide them. Another limitation is that backups with attachments can only be exported every 48 hours with Jira Backup Manager.\nFinally, while Backup Manager supports restores as imports, they can only be done on an account-level basis. Item-level restores aren’t supported, and your restores need to be\ninitiated manually\n.\nJira has been developing another command line interface-based backup and data recovery solution. However, it’s currently in an Early Access Phase for testing purposes only, and Atlassian has specifically stated that it’s\nnot to be used\nin production environments.\nRewind Backups for Jira\nRewind Backups for Jira\nis a managed service that automates daily backups with advanced data recovery capabilities. It offers one-click account recovery and granular, item-level restores. This means you can recover from human errors; disasters and outages; hardware, system, and application failure/incompatibility issues; and any other type of data loss scenario in a few clicks.\nSetup takes only a couple of minutes on the Atlassian marketplace. Backups and restores include comprehensive data coverage for items on Jira Cloud,\nJira Service Management\n, and Jira Work Management, including pages, spaces, attachments, comments, templates, themes, and\nmore\n).\nLearn more about\nJira Backup Manager vs. Rewind Backups for Jira in our comprehensive summary.\nWhat to do when Jira is down: summing up\nFor many good reasons, Jira is a popular favorite among modern software development and project management teams. But like anything in life, it’s not infallible.\nIf your Jira data is unavailable, whether it’s a disaster scenario or a smaller mistake, waiting around for the problem to be fixed is a waste of your team’s resources (not to mention extremely frustrating). A reliable backup and recovery process ensures you always have access to the information driving your business.\nHow many Jira Users are in your organization?\n* Jira Service Management and Jira Work Management are included in Rewind Backups for Jira Cloud.\nFlat Fee\nFor organizations under 10 users\n$40.00\nUSD / month\n$4.00\nUSD / user / month\nStart my trial\nProfessional plan\n$200\nUSD / month\n$4.00\nUSD / user / month\nStart my trial\nProfessional plan\n$200\nUSD / month\n$4.00\nUSD / user / month\nStart my trial\nProfessional plan\n$200\nUSD / month\n$4.00\nUSD / user / month\nTalk to sales\nGet in touch\nLoading…\nShare on social media:\nSarah Bader\n\">\nSarah Bader\nSarah Bader is a content writer, tech enthusiast, and passionate supporter of the Oxford Comma.

Rising Stars receive a certificate of achievement and are on the path to becoming Community Champions.\nGet recognized\nOctober 10, 2017\nedited\nThe backup is a guess, but it's happened to me more than once.\nThe idea is that the database has a \"pool\" of connections so nothing gets overloaded.  If, for example, you've got a pool of 20, then applications can connect up to 20 times, with each connection running a query or batch of them, then quitting.  If it reaches the limit running at the same time, then any new connections are forced to wait until one of the entries in the pool is freed up.  In your case, it's having to wait too long for one to become clear, which suggests something else is consuming the connections.  Backups often grab connections and hold them for a very long time.\nYou'll need to talk to your DBAs about fixing this, either by limiting the backups so they don't interfere, or if it's ok to increase the limit for Jira.\nYou must be a registered user to add a comment.

We gave Jira more memory (which definitely helped because now the GUI is actually loading, and telling us it cant reach the DB).\nWe tried to update the amount of pools to 50, but it still couldnt connect. The other 2 suggestions given was the DB wasnt on or the username and password is missing. How do we tell if its on? And I dont remember setting a password, is there a default?\nWe were also looking at the dbconfig.xml file and it references h2db directory but we just have h2db.mv.db and h2db.trace.db. Do we need to edit our XML file?\nYou must be a registered user to add a comment. If you've already registered, sign in.

and Fix Java Crashes in Jira Data Center and Server\nPlatform Notice: Data Center Only\n- This article only applies to Atlassian apps on the\nData Center platform\n.\nNote that this KB was created for the Data Center version of the product. Data Center KBs for non-Data-Center-specific features may also work for Server versions of the product, however they have not been tested.\nSupport for Server* products ended on\nFebruary 15th 2024\n. If you are running a Server product, you can visit the\nAtlassian Server end of support\nannouncement to review your migration options.\n*Except Fisheye and Crucible\nSummary\nJIRA (and other webapps) are completely unavailable.\nThe Java process is not running and it was not shut down manually.\nFiles with names like\nhs_err_pid20929.log\nbeing created in the app server's\nbin\ndirectory, containing text such as the below:\n#\n# An unexpected error has been detected by HotSpot Virtual Machine:\n#\n#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0xfe9bb960, pid=20929, tid=17\n#\n# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (1.5.0_01-b08 mixed mode)\n# Problematic frame:\n# V  [libjvm.so+0x1bb960]\n#\n---------------  T H R E A D  ---------------\nCurrent thread (0x01a770e0):  JavaThread \"JiraQuartzScheduler_Worker-1\" [_thread_in_vm, id=17]\nsiginfo:si_signo=11, si_errno=0, si_code=1, si_addr=0x00000000\nRegisters:\nO0=0xf5999882 O1=0xf5999882 O2=0x00000000 O3=0x00000000\nO4=0x00000000 O5=0x00000001 O6=0xc24ff0b0 O7=0x00008000\nG1=0xfe9bb80c G2=0xf5999a48 G3=0x0a67677d G4=0xf5999882\nG5=0xc24ff380 G6=0x00000000 G7=0xfdbc3800 Y=0x00000000\nPC=0xfe9bb960 nPC=0xfe9bb964\nThis indicates Java is crashing.\nDiagnosis\nReview the JVM crash log (hs_err_pid*.log) generated at the time of the crash.\nIdentify error codes such as EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION, SIGSEGV, or SIGBUS.\nCheck for problematic frames referencing third-party libraries (e.g., tcnative-1.dll,\nlibzip.so\n, SentinelJava64.dll).\nVerify Java version; known bugs affect certain releases (e.g., Java 1.8.0_25, 1.8.0_31).\nIn clustered setups, ensure no symlinks exist between Jira local and shared home directories.\nRemove or update conflicting JVM arguments or third-party agents.\nUpgrade Java to a stable, supported version if necessary.\nCause\nWeb applications like JIRA and Confluence run in a\nJava virtual machine\n(JVM). The virtual machine is responsible for emulating a CPU, managing memory and devices, just like the operating system does for native applications (MS Office, web browsers etc).\nA Java virtual machine crash is analogous to getting a Windows\nBlue Screen of Death\nwhen using MS Office or a web browser.\nThat said, JVM bugs causing crashes often appear when the JVM is running out of memory. The\nhs_err_pid*.log\nfile should list the state of memory at the time of the crash. If the JVM was low on memory, then it's a good idea to read the\nJIRA Crashes Due to 'OutOfMemoryError Java heap space'\npage and follow the suggestions there.\nSolution\nDownload the latest JDK\nand use it. Crashes are often caused by JDK bugs that get fixed over time. This is true for\nJVM Segfault (SIGSEGV) After Plugin Initialisation\n.\nEnsure that your operating system is one of the\nSupported System Configurations\n, and (especially for Solaris) ensure that the operating system has all current required patches applied.\nIn rare circumstances, bugs in the product can cause a SIGSEGV fault, like\nJSWSERVER-1465 - Greenhopper can crash 64bit JVMs under Linux\nAnd of course, you can always\nlet us know\n(include the hs_err_pid) file), and we can provide advise taking into account the specifics of your situation.\nUpdated on\nSeptember 26, 2025\nWas

Jira enables teams to plan, track projects, release software, generate reports, and automate processes. The project management tool also integrates with many test management tools for a more seamless quality assurance process.\nAlthough Jira has become the industry standard for project management software among Agile teams, like most complex tools, one size does not always fit all. Jira can also be tricky to work with if you work on the testing or QA team. In this post, we aim to cover common Jira problems that QA teams face, the biggest complaints teams have about Jira, and what you can do to address them.\nHow to search for issues in Jira\n“I can’t find anything in Jira!”\nEvery bug and every great idea your team has is logged somewhere in Jira, but no one knows how to find them — it’s a legitimate complaint. Between sprint boards, backlogs, projects, and roadmaps, there are many places where issues can hide. However, there are some solutions.\nFinding work items in Jira starts outside of Jira\nStep 1: Establish common terms and language.\nYour team needs to agree on the words they’ll use to describe the work you do. If you call the new feature the “onboarding widget” and I call it the “new user flow,” both may be accurate. However, using different terms is inefficient, our team is likely to get confused, and the conflicting terminology will make it difficult to find, analyze, and organize work. A common language provides clarity throughout the project and will improve communication, collaboration, and organization.\nStep 2: Make issues easy to find.\nIt would be best if you defined your work using unique and searchable terms. “Onboarding” is going to be a more concise term to look for later, whereas “flow” and “user” might get used in several places — making your searches confusing and inefficient.\nThe team should also agree on the definitions for items like the status field in Jira, so that the search criteria and filters for all project aspects are effective and use a common language just like titles and keywords. For example, what is your team’s definition of “done” for a status of “RESOLVED”? If different team members define “RESOLVED” in different ways, you can imagine how quickly your project management would fall into disarray.\nStep 3: Use key terms in the titles of your work items.\nTry to begin the name of every item you log with a term universally understood by the team. This term will indicate specific features or areas of the code that allow you to search and sort based on a set of meaningful terms for the team.\nFor example, a team working on a new address form feature might start all of their Jira items with something like “[address],” “(address),” or “Address -.” Whether you use square brackets, parenthesis, or a dash to distinguish this key term from the rest of the title does not matter as long as the team uses the same format consistently.\nRemember, your team needs to be able to access information without your help. If you use language that is only meaningful to you, then:\nNo one else can search effectively, and your work may be lost\nWork that should be grouped together might get missed when someone else searches for it\nYou become a bottleneck because you’re the only one who can ever find anything!\nStep 4: Know how to search Jira\nThere’s more than one way to conduct a search in Jira, and it’s important to know which is the best method for your needs. Jira has\npowerful advanced search options\nthat utilize its own Jira Query Language (JQL) — but for our purposes, we’re going to be focusing on more basic searches. Most QA team members will be able to find what they need in Jira using a general quick search, an issue search, or a board search.\nA\nJira quick search\nsearches issues, boards, projects, queues, recent items, and more — across all Jira items that you has access to. This is the broadest way to search within Jira.\nA\nJira issue search\nallows users to filter and search all of the issues within a single project, including issues that you’ve marked as “done” in the past. You can also utilize Advanced Search to\nsearch and filter issues across multiple projects.\nA\nJira board search\nsearches or filters only within the selected board. This is a useful way for you to quickly find timely issues — for example, work assigned to them during the current sprint.\nHow to create labels in Jira\nBesides establishing meaningful terms and categories for your work, you can use issue fields like labels to add more contextual information to your issues and make them easier to find later. You can use as many labels as you want on a ticket. Once you have some stored, they show up as you start typing, so it’s easy to reuse them.\nThese labels can be product-related or engineering-focused. On your team, any given ticket might have the labels “buy flow,” “fees,” “order history,” or “customer reported.” These may seem generic, but each term has meaning to the team and points to specific pages, functionality, and visibility.\nOnce you label everything, you can build better queries. You can search for all “buy flow” tickets and add “customer reported” to that list. Keep an organized spreadsheet of your labels so that your team knows what each term means. Set expectations that everyone contributes so that there’s a common agreement on the same language to describe the team’s work. This kind of documentation can seem unwieldy, especially for new team members — so be sure to add a reminder to your onboarding checklist to walk through how the team uses Jira and where to find the common terms everyone uses.\nHow to manage Jira tickets\n“The backlog is a mess!”\nIt’s easy to create a chaotic pile of tickets that turns into a never-ending backlog of issues. Worse yet, duplicate items are entered and start adding to the mess. It becomes challenging to get anything done, and at that point, the system begins to break down. Implementing a prescribed process to filter, sort, and focus your backlog items is the answer.\nJira Epics\nEpics are great for organizing, but they’re not just a label. The epic helps you manage smaller tasks that are part of a larger deliverable or milestone. Depending on the type of Jira project you’re using, you can set the epic tag to show up in the backlog, which helps you quickly identify items that belong together. Although no team plans to have hundreds of items in the project backlog, for many, it inevitably happens. When you create epics, you help your teammates spot any tickets that might be evaluated together.\nAnother helpful feature of an epic is that all the linked issues display in a filtered list. You can quickly scan through that list, see the status of everything, and add a description that explains the goals and purpose of that group of tickets.\nIf you have the\nroadmap feature\nenabled on your Jira project, you can also view and plan Epics in a Gantt chart-style “roadmap view,” allowing you to see deadlines, dependencies, and team capacity at a glance.\nAn example of how one team member’s Jira tickets are falling across Q3 sprints\nSprints\nSprints are another way to plan work and provide a focus for the team using time-boxing to complete a set amount of work. Common sprint timeframes are two weeks, one week, or one month, with the goal being for the team to assign themselves no more than the work they can complete within that sprint timeframe, commit to finishing that work within the allotted time, and reject any other projects that come up along the way. When assigning work to a sprint, you can view tickets on a kanban board with custom status columns, and suddenly progress becomes obvious.  If you’re working on an Agile team and using Jira, this is likely your team’s main view.\nAn active sprint in Jira (Image via atlassian.com)\nHere’s another hint for those who can’t find anything in Jira (including the sprint board): If your team has a dedicated Slack channel for the current project, try setting the channel topic as the link to the Jira sprint board.\nCreating a Jira permission scheme\n“I can’t change that field!”\nOne of the hardest decisions an administrator faces when setting up a tool for a team is what powers you grant to each user. Jira allows granular options for permissions and access. You can trust widely and keep everything as open as possible, or you can restrict everything down to just the permissions someone needs for their role.\nIt’s easy to understand why having access to too much could be distracting and potentially dangerous. However, when working on collaborative teams, it’s important to train and trust. It can be frustrating to a team member to learn that Jira administrators can do all kinds of things that make their jobs easier, and they can’t.\nAdmins should leave certain options open for their team and take advantage of some Jira abilities to make things easier.\nBulk update Jira tickets\nBulk updating is a powerful feature that some teams restrict. You might be tempted to restrict this because someone once updated a bunch of tickets incorrectly, or you might feel strongly that developers and testers should be adding comments to provide some information every time they interact with a ticket. But even the most detailed teams need shortcuts sometimes.\nFor example, status is a common field that everyone on the team needs to update — and often on several tickets at once. Perhaps it’s a bunch of tickets that are deployed to a staging environment and ready to test. It may be that you want to split apart an existing epic or add a new label to several tickets. Whatever the reason, teams need to be able to move quickly. The more administrative work you require, the more people will feel frustrated with the tool.\nMoving issues in Jira\nEveryone on the team needs to be able to move issues. In Jira, this means changing the project designation or the issue type. Most QA teams have different workflows for different issue types, so you need to offer your team the flexibility to change any logged issue to fit the work required.\nA common example is a subtask created in a user story. Once the developer digs into a subtask, they learn more about the work. Sometimes what looked like a simple task turns out to be more complex than originally expected. In cases like this, it may make sense to break out this task into its own story instead.\nMoreover, if you want your team to track their work and close out stories at the end of a sprint, then you have to allow them to modify tickets.\nCreate a Jira status workflow\nThe status of an issue in Jira can be incredibly valuable in understanding what work has been done and what work needs to come next.\nCreate a basic workflow that utilizes common statuses, like To Do, In Progress, Code Review, Testing, Ready for Deploy, and Done. These may vary depending on your environment but most tickets move predictably through these different stages. Work with your QA team to build a column flow that’s simple enough to be completed reliably, but also provides enough insight into the testing process to provide needed visibility. Ideally, the tool is smart enough to suggest the next step in the flow for you.\nAn example Jira status workflow\nProblems arise when you want to do anything that doesn’t nicely adhere to the desired flow. This happens in all kinds of ways. You may have a developer who falls behind on updating tickets. The ticket stays in the To Do status even though it’s already been completed and it’s in code review. If you require that the ticket move through each step, you just have more administrative overhead to keep things up to date.\nForcing someone to adhere to a specific flow doesn’t fix process and communication problems. Ask yourself, is it more important that the work is complete or if the board is up to date? If the team agrees that proper status on the board is vital, then discuss why — and decide on a strategy for moving the workflow along without bogging anyone down with administrative work that may not be mission-critical.\nSometimes the work changes after you get started. Steps that you previously imagined necessary end up being optional to complete the work. Or, what you thought might need three separate user stories gets done in one and now you’re moving three tickets forward for one ticket’s progress.\nYou can set up Jira to suggest the next step but allow the user to pick any status for the times you just need to skip a step or even backtrack.\nCapturing data in Jira ticket fields\n“What do I really need to include in my Jira ticket?”\nWhen creating a new Jira ticket, you can provide a template of suggested information or create custom fields to capture all the data you want. Ask for everything important to you, but don’t require anything beyond the most basic pieces. Some basic fields you require might be project, issue type, title, and description. That isn’t enough information in most cases, but it is enough to get started.\nOften, team members are logging notes about an issue they discovered while they were in the middle of something else. Make it easy for someone to record their thoughts quickly and come back when they have more time. Besides, not every work item that gets logged will require every field that you could possibly want.\nSome commonly used Jira fields in software development are:\nRelease version\nFix version\nComponents\nSeverity\nPriority\nLabels\nEstimate\nPlatform\nEnvironment\nCustom Jira Fields\nFor ticket information that requires more space or complexity than the detail fields allow, such as acceptance criteria, you can also add additional custom description fields to allow free-text entry. This empowers your developers to provide additional clarity and context to your QA team around the goals of their testing! Acceptance criteria should proactively clear up any confusion for your testing team around\nwhat to test\n, where to test, and what the user story should be doing.\nAdding an “Acceptance Criteria” description field in a new Jira task\nYou may be tempted to require specific fields or specific parts of the workflow in order to address process or staff problems. If you have a staff member who regularly doesn’t report enough information in the items that they log, that’s not going to change just because you add additional fields or provide a template. It is far more compelling to explain to that team member why you need that information and how it helps the team than to force them into a workflow that will require it.\nUltimately, the tool is there to enhance team communication. Jira is not a replacement for standups, questions, discussions, and constructive feedback!\nLink bugs to Jira stories\nWhenever logging a bug in Jira, it’s vital to tie it to the issue that you were testing when the bug was discovered. You can do this by either linking the two issues or creating bugs as a child issue under the original parent story.\nCreating bugs as new Jira issues and linking them to the story that was being tested when the bug was found is a common way to approach this. If that sounds like a lot of administrative work, then an integration with your testing platform might help. For example, the\nTestRail Jira integration\nthat we’ll talk about in the next section has built-in support for issue linking, which will automatically link the bug issue and parent story and upload all relevant testing data to Jira when you push defects from TestRail.\nAn example of TestRail test cases linked to a Jira story\nSome teams prefer to add bugs/defects as a child issue under the original story, which accomplishes the same goals — but keep in mind that if you link your bugs this way, you’ll be unable to close the parent story without resolving the child bug issues.\nBoth methods are perfectly valid — it’s just a matter of choosing which one is the best for your team and using it consistently. Getting into the practice of consistently linking issues and using references between Jira and your test management tool will also allow you to quickly run reports to check the status of test cases associated with Jira stories at-a-glance. Additionally, good linking and reference hygiene prevents versioning confusion and ensures all tests are being run on the correct version of your software.\nIntegrate Jira with your tech stack\n“Why do I have to post the same information in so many places?”\nIf you’re regularly using tools that have integrations with Jira, explore those. Integrations help you to connect information from various systems you use so you don’t need to update everything everywhere. Here are a few tools your team may be using alongside Jira.\nSlack Jira Integration\nThis integration\nallows you to set certain projects to update in different project channels. This way, when anyone types a ticket number in Slack, the link to the corresponding Jira ticket follows. This makes it easy to collaborate with others on any given ticket so team members can find and follow up on any issue that makes it into a Slack discussion.\nGitHub Jira Integration\nIntegrating Jira with your GitHub code\nallows you to reduce administrative overhead and increase visibility by linking Jira tickets with GitHub organizations and repositories. When all relevant Jira information is displayed in GitHub and vice versa, your whole team can see all of the latest updates and info at-a-glance without having to leave their primary platform.\nGitLab Jira Integration\nJira can also\nintegrate with your GitLab code repositories\n. This way, if a developer mentions a Jira issue in a commit, links will post automatically in the ticket. At the very least this shows that work has been done on an item. Utilized properly, the corresponding link will provide additional context about the changes.\nZendesk Jira Integration\nIf your customer service team uses Zendesk to track support issues, you can also set up a\nJira integration to link any Zendesk tickets\nto a related Jira item. This allows the engineering team to more accurately determine impact based on how many tickets are linked. It also empowers the support team to follow the links and review the comments and status of the Jira ticket in order to observe progress that has been made toward a fix.\nTestRail Jira Integration\nThe\nTestRail integration for Jira\nprovides a two-way sync between issues in Jira (bugs and requirements) and tests in TestRail so that you can build traceability, identify coverage gaps, and streamline processes using the tools that already work for your team’s unique workflows. This integration allows you to fully track traceability between your requirements in Jira and your test executions in TestRail and generate insightful reports at all stages of testing.\nThe TestRail-Jira integration allows you to connect Jira tickets and TestRail test cases for synchronized visibility from both platforms\nJira tickets can be updated directly from TestRail, reducing admin work\nFor a real-world example of how this integration helps teams improve visibility and prioritization, check out\nthis case study from OSIV\n, a Swiss government healthcare system.\nCommunicate Clearly and Empower Everyone\nThe goal for Jira is to have actionable information that enables your team to get work done.\nWork with your team to develop a common language, use that for everything that you log in to Jira, and then use those terms to create more powerful searches. Group the work in a way that makes sense for the team, allow your team to change the way the work is tracked and integrate with your other tools as much as possible to minimize redundant work.\nThese suggestions can lessen frustration with Jira as a tool, help your team track information better, and empower everyone working on a project together to share important information and updates with the team at large.\nLike in all collaborative systems, you want to make sure you spend your time on what is most valuable to your end goals. Always remember to ask yourself: Is it merely interesting, or is it actionable? Let go of what you no longer need. And don’t force a tool into the job of fixing your processes and communication!\nContributors:\nDee Ann Pizzica is a passionate and curious software tester.

My status columns are \"Open\" \"In progress\" \"In Review\" \"In Development\" and \"Done\".  Issues that are moved to the \"Done\" column are not showing as resolved in any of the reports I am trying to generate.\nI would like to be able to see how long issues spend in \"Open\", \"In Progress\" and \"In Review\" until they are done.  I would also like to see how many issues are created vs. how many issues are resolved but since I am unable to resolve issues I can't generate these reports.\nAnswer\nWatch\nLike\nBe the first to like this\nShare\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nCopy Link\n25878 views\n2 answers\n3\nvotes\nOday Rafeh\nRising Star\nRising Star\nRising Stars are recognized for providing high-quality answers to other users.

If the resolution field is not set, the issue might still be considered unresolved even if it's in the \"done\" column. To ensure your issues are resolved when moved to the \"done\" column, you can add a post-function to the workflow transition that sets the resolution value.\nHere are the steps to add a post-function to set the resolution value:\ngo to your project and click on \"project settings\" in the bottom left corner.\nClick on \"workflows\" in the left sidebar.\nFind the workflow that is associated with the issue types you are working with (usually named \"task management\" or similar). Click on the \"edit\" button in the actions menu (three vertical dots) to open the workflow editor.\nIn the workflow editor, click on the transition arrow that leads to the \"done\" status (e. G. , from \"in review\" to \"done\" or from \"in development\" to \"done\").\nClick on the \"post functions\" tab in the panel that appears on the right side.\nClick on the \"add post function\" button.\nSelect \"update issue field\" from the list and click on the \"add\" button.\nIn the \"issue field\" dropdown, select \"resolution. \"\nin the \"value\" dropdown, select a resolution value that you would like to set when an issue is transitioned to \"done\" (e. G. , \"done\" or \"fixed\"). Click on the \"add\" button to\nsave the post function.\nPublish the changes to your workflow.\nNow, when you move an issue to the \"done\" column, the resolution field will be set, and the issue will be considered resolved. This should allow you to generate the desired reports on issue resolution times and created vs. Resolved issues.\nFor the reports, you can use the built-in jira reports, such as the \"created vs. Resolved\" report or the \"time in status\" report. You can access these reports by going to your project and clicking on \"reports\" in the left sidebar. You may need to adjust the jql filter for these reports to accurately reflect your project and issue types.\nView More Comments\nYou must be a registered user to add a comment.

Question: will updating my workflow today also update the resolution for issues which have already been marked as Done? If not, what would be a good way to update this, so that the \"resolved date\" matches the actual date in which issues were resolved? Just as a reference, below is a screenshot of how a Created vs. Resolve graph looks; since our workflow is not yet updated, all the Resolved issues are not yet resolved, but I am wondering how it will look like once we update our workflow...\n- Will Jira automatically update the Resolved date to the Actual Date?\n- Wille Jira automatically update the Resolved date as the date in which I update my workflow?\n- Will Jira not automatically update the Resolved date, even after updating my workflow? If so, does Jira allow me to update each issue manually so that the Resolved date is updated?\nYou must be a registered user to add a comment. If you've already registered, sign in.

Bear with us while we update it to reflect the new changes.\nMore about navigating the new Jira\nWhat are problems?\nWhen a service has vulnerabilities, incidents can occur. Problems are the cause (or potential cause) of those incidents. Problems' relationship with incidents is one of cause and effect. Problems are the cause; incidents are the effect. They’re raised in response to a significant incident, smaller similar ones, or even when an incident hasn’t occurred yet (for example, you may find a flaw in your service that may result in an incident if not fixed).\nFixing an incident means to temporarily restore an impacted service. This may not be a permanent resolution, as the underlying cause hasn’t been fixed. Resolving a problem is a longer-term resolution, which may involve: investigating the incident, analyzing the situation, and developing a workaround.\nWas this helpful?\nYes\nNo\nIt wasn't

Set up a bug tracking project in Jira\nSetting up a bug tracking project in Jira Software is relatively uncomplicated.\nLog in to your organization’s workspace. The URL looks something like this: your-organization.atlassian.net/jira.\nIn the toolbar at the top, click “Projects”, then “Create Project”.\nUnder “Project Templates”, choose “Software Development”, then “Bug Tracking”.\nClick “Use Template”, then choose a name and a key.\nClick “Create Project”, and you’re good to go!\nThis project is now your dedicated bug tracker.\nThis is where your QA team and clients will report and track bugs and issues going forward—for the entire software development lifecycle.\nTell them: if it doesn’t exist there, then it doesn’t exist at all\n. This is your one and only source of truth.\nWith this setup, you can already create issues.\nThe default screen includes:\nIssue Type (bug, new feature request, improvement…)\nSummary\nand Description.\nWith a little extra customization, you can add assignee, sub-task, epic… but that’s for later!\nNext, let’s have a look at our workflow.\n2. Create custom Jira workflows\nSetting up a custom workflow in Jira is also relatively easy.\nOn the left side of the screen, go in “Project settings”, then “Worfklows” and click the icon under “Actions.”\nCreate as many statuses as you like, and don’t forget to set transitions to “All” so that statuses can be switched back and forth. Here, we’ve opted for a Jira workflow with few, but easy-to-follow steps: “To Do”, “Assigned”, “In Progress”, and “Done”.\nCongratulations! You Jira workflow is live, and you can now set a custom status for all of your issues.\n3. Create a Kanban board\nThe default “table” view is not great for keeping a visual overview of all issues.\nLet’s create a Kanban board that will make it easy to keep an eye on everything.\nOn the left, click “Boards”, then “Create board”.\nPick “Kanban”, then “Board from an existing project”.\nName your board (here, “bug tracker board”) and link it to your current project.\nAnd done! Now, this finally looks like a decent bug tracking tool.\nYou can edit issues straight from the board, and track the entire bug life cycle with ease.\nFeel free to add as many user stories, as well as all the relevant details straight from your Kanban board.\nJira also has options for a Scrum board if that’s your favorite way of working.\nResolving bugs has never been so easy. When working with these clearly defined stages, prioritizing bugs gets easier—and faster.\n4. Create custom issue types in Jira\nIf you wanna go one step further and have specific issue types (for example, Test Case), you’ll have to create your very own custom issue type.\nHere’s how to do this with Jira Software:\nInside Jira go to “Global Settings” and “Issues”.\nClick “Add Issue Type” and create a new issue type.\nGo to “Issue Type Scheme” settings, find your Jira Project, and click “Edit”.\nDrag your new Issue type into your project’s current scheme.\nNext, go to “Screen settings”, and “Add Screen”.\nPick the custom fields you want in this Issue type, (e.g. Summary, Description, Priority). Keep it simple, but always include Summary and Description.\nGo to “Screen Schemes” and “Add Screen Schemes”, create a new Screen scheme, and link it to your custom Screen.\nGo to “Issue Type Screen Scheme” and click on the Jira Classic project you are looking to use your new Issue type with, then “Associate an issue type with a screen scheme”, select your new issue type and its Screen Scheme, then click “Add”.\nCongratulations! You created a new custom Jira issue type with custom fields, scoped to a specific Jira project.\n5. Create a system to prioritize bugs\nIssue tracking is not just about creating a bug report and sending it off to your project management tool.\nAgile projects want to be able to prioritize newly created issues as soon as possible.\nIdeally, all reporters have a good grip on the level of bug severity. Unfortunately, that is often not the case!\nWe decided to go with a classic system for all of our Jira bugs:\nHighest\nHigh\nMedium\nLow\nLowest\nReporting bugs in Jira Software\nNow that you’ve successfully turned Jira into a strong defect tracking tool, it’s time to start reporting bugs.\nIt’s good to think about the people in charge of reporting bugs. There are generally two types of reporters:\nPeople with access to your Jira projects and backlog, such as your development team and your project manager;\nPeople without access to your Jira projects (your clients).\n1. Bug reporting for Jira users\nFor Jira users, you can let them report straight into the correct Jira project in real-time. They have permissions, understand how it works, and what the issue types mean.\nHowever, reporting issues and bugs into Jira is time-consuming.\nA regular bug reporting flow looks something like this:\nGo to staging, find a bug.\nTake a screenshot.\nGo to Figma/Photoshop… and import the screenshot.\nAnnotate it.\nPaste the annotated screenshot into a new Jira bug report.\nAssign the issue to the correct person, and add labels (functionality issue, design problem…).\nType out long explanations and all issue details, as well as multiple tasks.\nAdd technical info manually.\nSave and send it off to the developers.\nIf you don't want them to spend the time doing all this, you can always opt for automation—with a bug reporting tool like\nMarker.io\n.\nReporting bugs with Marker.io is a simple, 3-steps process:\nFind a bug, click the button.\nFill out the bug report and input issue details.\nClick on “Create issue”—done!\nAny bug report created this way will land straight into your Jira project, with all technical data attached.\nThis means developers can stay in Jira, not adopt another tool, and do what they do best: bug fixing!\n2. Bug reporting for non-Jira users\nFor reporters without access to Jira, you have two options.\nRequest detailed emails that one of your team members transfers into Jira. Hint: you can\nautomatically create Jira issues from email\n, too.\nYou let them the Marker.io plugin as well.\nWith Marker.io, you can invite your clients and external testers as Guests.\nThis means that they see a limited submission form so internal details stay secure, and you still get all the information you need sent straight into your Jira.\nWith Guests, it is definitely advisable to set up a dedicated, separate Jira project for issue tracking.\nThe PM can easily go in and check the issues before sending them to the devs! This is an extra step that saves you a lot of time in the long run.\nCommunicating on issues within Jira\nBug tracking in Jira is just one part of the equation.\nA good communication process between development team, project manager, and client is paramount to your success.\nOne of the biggest problems with Jira for bug reporting is that you need to do a lot of alt-tabbing between tools to collect all information.\nYou might have seen an issue like this…\nThis will easily turn your developers crazy.\nDevelopers need a baseline if they want to fix bugs in a timely fashion!\nIf you want to reduce time-wasting phone calls and frustrated developers, you need to be concise and complete at the same time.\nIn order to\nwrite the perfect bug report\n, you’ll need to attach this information at the very least:\nTitle\nDescription/Summary\nReporter information\nSource URL\nConsole logs\nEnvironment: browser, operating system, zoom level, and screen size\nScreenshot/visual proof\nHint: use one of our pre-made\nbug report templates\nto make sure you didn’t miss anything.\nWant your developers to love you?\nTickets you create via Marker.io automatically get enriched with technical metadata and console logs.\nNeed to discuss a particular issue at length?\nIn most cases, teams resort to long email chains or phone calls.\nIf you use a tool like Marker.io though, you can discuss issues straight from the dashboard.\nAnd thanks to our advanced 2-way sync, all messages from your clients or external reporters will land straight into Jira.\nSuper helpful when you’re trying to work fast.\nResolving bugs and notifying clients\nAfter you or your developers close a Jira issue, you need to notify the reporter.\nThis also prevents impatient follow-up emails or calls.\nIt is always advisable to use the same channels of communication as you used before.\nOption 1: Email\nIt is an obvious choice, and with good reason. People check their emails all the time.\nWhen sending emails, always attach:\nThe issue number\nThe title\nA screenshot of the issue before it got resolved\nThis is especially relevant when working with people who have no access to your Jira. They tend to forget the details of what they reported.\nOption 2: Marker.io\nMarker.io comes with automated status sync.\nThis means that when you close an issue in Jira, it automatically also closes in Marker.io.\nYour reporters will receive notifications through automated email or Guest Portal updates. A good way to save time!\nYour next steps\nSet up a bug tracking project in Jira, using the tutorial above.\nSign up for\nMarker.io for Jira\n—and report bugs twice as fast.\nLet us know what you think about this article via Twitter or e-mail!\nWrapping up...\nJira as a project management system is as popular as it is for good reason!\nIt is powerful, highly customizable, and allows complex workflows with ease.

Whether you’re a QA specialist, product owner, or developer testing your own features, how you describe a bug matters.\nAt TitanApps, we work across multiple\nSmart Tools for Jira\n(like Smart Checklist, Smart Templates), and bugs can come from anywhere: internal testing by QA, customers, or even colleagues’ feedback. To make sure bugs are reproducible and prioritized correctly, we’ve developed a consistent reporting process — and it lives entirely inside Jira.\nInstead of jumping between spreadsheets or Slack threads, we rely on\nJira issue templates\n,\nproject-level structure\n, and\ncustomized boards\nto keep the process clear for both QA and developers.\nIn this guide, we’ll walk you through:\nWhat a bug report is and why it matters\nWhich Jira fields we use and how to fill them\nCommon best practices and automation tips\nTitanApps-specific examples and caveats\nWhat Is a Bug Report and Why Does It Matter?\nA bug report is a Jira issue that describes a problem in the product: something that doesn’t work as expected, breaks under specific conditions, or disrupts the user experience. Bug report is a technical artifact that helps developers understand, reproduce, and fix the problem.\nA good bug report does three things:\nExplains what’s broken\nDescribes how to reproduce it\nHelps the team decide how urgent the fix is\nBug report is important because in real teams:\nDevelopers don’t always know the feature context.\nProduct managers need to prioritize bugs among feature work.\nQA needs to track what’s fixed and what’s still in limbo.\nSupport needs to find and reference bug reports for customer issues.\nA well-written bug report saves time for everyone  and makes sure serious problems don’t fall through the cracks.\nBug Reporting Fields in Jira (And How to Use Them)\nAt TitanApps, we’ve developed a practical approach to structuring bug reports in Jira that helps reduce noise, improves developer efficiency, and ensures accountability across QA, devs, and PMs. The setup relies entirely on Jira Cloud, without additional tools though the same logic can be adapted to more advanced test management systems if needed.\nOur core principle is simple: when QA creates a bug, the ticket must already contain everything needed to reproduce and prioritize it. To support that, we’ve configured a\ndefault work type\nfor software project with several required fields.\nNote:\nThis workflow works well for us,  but every team is different. Some companies don’t use\nseverity\n, others don’t link bugs to sprints, and automation setups vary. Use this as a guide, not as an instruction to follow for all use cases.\nTo ensure each bug report is clear, actionable, and complete, make the following fields mandatory when configuring the Bug issue type in Jira:\nField\nDescription\nBest Practices\nSummary\nShort title of the bug\nUse the \"What–Where–When\" format. Include key info like affected feature, platform, or trigger (e.g., “[Forge] Templates are not applied to the issue on issue creation when they are assigned to the issue types”). Should be descriptive enough to understand the issue without opening the full ticket.\nDescription\nFull bug details\nFull bug details\nSteps to Reproduce\nActual Result\nExpected Result\n(Optional)\nPrerequisites\n– conditions required before steps (e.g., user has 500+ templates).\nLet’s go into more details of each section:\nSummary\nThe summary is the first and often only thing a developer or product manager reads at a glance, especially when skimming boards or release scopes. That’s why we write it as a compressed description of the problem. It should follow a clear “What – Where – When” structure\nTitanApps tip:\nSummary is\nthe first thing everyone sees\n– devs, PMs, support, and even customers (via linked portals). It should be clear and concise, ideally under 255 characters (Jira’s limit). We try to write summaries that make the bug self-explanatory, even if someone never reads the description.\nDescription\nPurpose:\nA detailed breakdown of the problem, including how to reproduce it.\nWe use a clear format:\nPrerequisites (optional)\n– conditions required to see the bug\nSteps to Reproduce\n– written in bullet form\nActual Result\n– what happened\nExpected Result\n– what should have happened\nThis structure can be pre-filled using Smart Templates or added manually. The most important thing is clarity: we want anyone, even someone unfamiliar with the feature, to be able to reproduce the bug based on this description alone. When needed, we also include supporting artifacts: screenshots, short video recordings (e.g., Loom), and logs.They’re easier to grasp than written steps alone. Especially helpful when dealing with visual bugs or bugs that depend on specific UI states.\nAs one of our QA team members explained, the description should be so detailed and well-structured that a developer doesn’t need to ping QA for clarification. And yet, not so bloated that the main points get lost.\nPriority\nPriority indicates how urgent the fix is. It answers the question: how soon does this need to be addressed?\nWe typically use categories like\nMust\n,\nShould\n, or\nCould\n. “Must” is used when core functionality is broken, especially if it affects production or delays a release. “Should” covers important but non-blocking issues. “Could” is for things that are minor, cosmetic, or unlikely to be noticed by users.\nIn TitanApps team QA usually sets the initial priority, but PMs or team leads can revise it during triage.\nSeverity\n(optional, varies by team)\nPurpose:\nMeasures the business or reputational impact, regardless of technical complexity.\nSome common cases to use\nSeverity\nwhen bugs:\nAppear in highly visible areas (e.g., product homepage, customer-facing UI)\nAffect branding (e.g., a typo in the company name)\nDon’t block the product technically but damage perception\nNote: Severity is different from priority. A bug can have high severity (e.g., offensive word on homepage) but low priority if it’s easy to ignore for a few days.For example, a bug that displays a typo in the company name on the landing page may not break any functionality, but it’s still considered high severity.\nAs we mentioned before, not all teams use this field\n.\nIn some Jira setups, only priority is tracked or severity is logged in description or labels. In some setups (and in some TitanApps projects), severity is omitted entirely or treated as an internal classification by QA. In others, it’s explicitly configured and used alongside priority.\nThe key thing to remember is that these two don’t always align. A bug can be severe but not urgent (if the issue hasn’t reached customers yet), or urgent but not severe (like a minor functional issue that’s blocking a critical release).\nComponents\nComponents let us define which part of the product the bug belongs to. For example, Smart Checklist, Smart Templates, or Forge integration. These are useful for filtering issues on boards, assigning ownership, and creating rules that auto-assign bugs to the correct developer.\nOne challenge we faced early on was deciding whether to use separate Jira projects per app or to consolidate everything under a single project and organize by components. We chose the latter for simplicity, using components to reflect both the product and the platform (e.g., DC vs Cloud).\nPurpose:\nShows which module or feature the bug affects (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Forge, DC).\nTitanApps use case:\nWe group our bugs by components like Smart Templates, Smart Checklist, Forge, DC. This helps with:\nAuto-assignment to the right developer\nFiltering on boards\nAnalytics and reporting\nSprint\nCritical bugs found during regression testing go straight into the current active sprint, regardless of whether the sprint is “frozen.” Others may be logged into Icebox or scheduled for future work.\nNote from TitanApps team: The bug’s inclusion in a sprint is tied more to\nimpact on the release\nthan technical complexity. If the bug is a release blocker, it enters the current sprint immediately.\nWhen we use it:\nCritical bugs – Added to the current active sprint\nNon-critical bugs – Moved to Icebox/backlog\nBugs from upcoming features – Tagged to the sprint containing the feature work\nIf a live release is broken, the bug goes straight into the current sprint, even if the sprint scope is already full. We treat it as an emergency scope.\nLabels\nLabels are flexible tags we use for filtering, visibility, and sometimes automation. These can include support, tech-debt, hotfix-staging, e2e, or specific team tags. They help us slice and dice bugs when doing post-mortems, retrospectives, or sprint wrap-ups.\nWe often filter by label during sprint retrospectives to see how many  release-blockers we had and whether they were caught early.\nEnvironment\nKnowing where a bug occurred is critical for debugging. At TitanApps, we track whether the bug was found on staging, production, or a local dev environment. If the Environment field isn’t configured in Jira, we include this info at the top of the Description field.\nQA often notes variations in bug behavior across environments. For example, a bug might appear only in staging but not in production, or only under a specific feature flag setup.\nBest practice:\nInclude this either in a dedicated\nEnvironment\nfield (if configured) or at the top of the\nDescription\n.\nExamples:\nStaging – during QA testing\nProduction – reported by customer\nDevelopment – caught by devs before commit\nReporter & Assignee\nThe Reporter field is filled automatically by Jira and it’s whoever created the issue. The Assignee, on the other hand, can be manually selected or assigned via automation rules. In some cases, we configure auto-assignment based on the selected component. For example, any bug with Smart Checklist as a component can go directly to that module’s lead developer.\nIn smaller teams, QA may leave Assignee empty and let devs triage issues during standups. In larger setups, auto-assignment becomes essential to avoid things falling through the cracks.\nAffects Version / Fix Version\nThese fields are used to track where the bug appeared (Affects Version) and where it’s expected to be fixed (Fix Version). This is particularly helpful when validating releases or conducting QA sign-off.\nNot every team uses these fields rigorously. But when used, they provide a clear version trail that helps QA test fixes against the correct builds, especially in release-heavy environments.\nLinked Issues\nWe link bugs to their related Stories, Epics, or other bugs. This gives context: is this bug part of a larger feature rollout? Is it blocking another ticket? Was it caused by a specific change in a Story?\nAs one QA noted during a team discussion, this also helps support teams trace customer-reported bugs back to their origin, especially when customers reference a broken feature without knowing the underlying implementation.\nAttachments (optional but recommended)\nWe often include:\nScreenshots\nof the bug state\nVideos\n(via Loom or screen capture)\nLogs\n(if backend error)\nSample files\n(e.g., uploaded config that caused failure)\nThe more context we give, the faster the devs can reproduce the issue  and avoid bouncing tickets back and forth.\nHow a Good Bug Report Looks Like – Examples\nA well-written bug report is a communication tool. It reduces questions, speeds up fixes, and helps teams track recurring patterns across releases. In our workflow at TitanApps, a good bug report is structured, neutral in tone, and complete enough that developers can take action without back-and-forth clarification.\nThe best reports follow a consistent internal standard, whether the bug was discovered by QA during regression testing, by a developer working on a feature, or by support relaying customer input.\nHere’s what we expect a strong bug report to contain:\n1. Clear and Informative Summary\nA good summary acts like the headline of a newspaper article. It should let the reader instantly understand what the problem is, where it happens, and (if applicable) when or under what conditions it occurs.\nBad example:\n“Something’s broken in the checklist”\nBetter example:\n“[Forge] Templates are not applied to the issue on issue creation when they are assigned to the issue types”\nThis second version immediately tells us:\nThe functionality affected (Template assignment)\nThe platform (Forge)\nThe condition (Issue creation)\nThis clarity allows faster triage, especially when hundreds of issues are open at once. It also improves issue filtering and searching — something the support team relies on when referencing bugs from customer reports.\n2. Structured Description\nThe description field carries most of the information — and it must be easy to scan. At TitanApps, we follow a standardized template that includes these parts:\nPrerequisites (optional)\nConditions that must exist before the bug can be reproduced. These may include account setup, feature flags, data thresholds (e.g., “500+ templates exist”), or user roles.\nSteps to Reproduce\nA simple, numbered list that anyone can follow,  even without deep product knowledge. Avoid assumptions or hidden steps.\nExample:\n1. Open any Jira issue of type ‘General’\n2. Click Smart Checklist > Apply Template\n3. Select any saved template\n4. Click ‘Apply’\nActual Result\nDescribe exactly what happens after the final step. Be specific, and include what’s visible on screen, error messages, or unexpected behaviors.\nExample:\nThe template appears to apply, but nothing is shown in the checklist. No error is displayed.\nExpected Result\nExplain what the correct behavior should be under the same conditions.\nExample:\nThe selected template should populate the checklist tab with its content.\n3. Attachments and Environment Context\nGood bug reports include relevant supporting evidence. Screenshots, Loom videos, or logs help developers see the issue in action, especially when the bug is visual or involves UI interactions. Videos are particularly helpful when the bug is intermittent or hard to describe.\nWe also include the environment in which the bug occurred –  usually Staging, Production, or Development. If it’s not a dedicated Jira field, it should be included at the top of the Description section.\nTitanApps tip:\nAlways indicate the environment and user conditions. Many of our regressions behave differently on Staging vs Production, especially with Forge apps.\n4. Neutral, Precise Tone\nThe tone of a bug report should be factual, not emotional. Avoid phrases like:\n“This is completely broken”\n“It works terribly”\n“Seems fine to me”\nInstead, stick to concrete observations:\n“The apply button is unresponsive after clicking”\n“There is no visual confirmation that the template applied”\n“Expected behavior: checklist should populate instantly”\nEven if the bug is frustrating or causes a delay, the goal of the report is to support resolution.\n5. Proper Use of Fields\nAs covered earlier, the bug should have all required fields filled in:\nPriority\n: “Must” for blockers, “Should” for minor bugs with workarounds\nComponents\n: e.g., Smart Templates, Frontend, DC\nLabels\n: customer-report, release-blocker, Forge\nAssignee\n: Assigned based on component or via triage\nLinked Issues\n: Connected to the Epic or Story if the bug is tied to recent work\nAt TitanApps, we enforce this through a combination of:\nCustom required fields in the Bug issue type\nSmart Checklist for bug tickets to ensure description format\nValidators in the workflow to block transitions unless core fields are complete\n6. Example Bug Report\nName of the issue: [Forge] Templates are not applied to the issue on issue creation when they are assigned to the issue types\nDescription:\nSTR:\nOpen any issue\nClick on SC 3-dots menu > Manage templates\nExpand any template (project/global/linked) > assign to all issue types\nExpand another template  (project/global/linked) > assign to specific issue type\nCreate issue with this issue type\nVerify the checklist\nActual Result:\nTemplates are not applied to the issue on issue creation\nExpected Result:\nTemplates should be applied based on the assignment on issue creation\nIssue is reproduced on dev/staging envs. On production it is working as expected.\nIn developer logs:\nAttachments:\n– Video recording of the issue\nPriority:\nMust\nComponent:\nJira-checklist-Cloud\nLabels:\nhot-fix-staging\nFix version\n: [SC][Forge] Release Sprint 95\nAssignee:\nMaria Solovey\nLinked Issue:\nTA-9428 ([Forge] Review and address typing errors in the logs)\nA report like this takes only a few extra minutes to write properly, but it saves hours of follow-up and makes sure the bug moves quickly through the lifecycle.\nAutomation Rules for Bug Reporting in Jira\nJira’s native automation engine is a powerful tool for keeping your bug reporting process clean, consistent, and fast. At TitanApps, we use\nmanually triggered\nand\ncondition-based automation rules\nto streamline key steps like assigning bugs, applying labels, notifying stakeholders, and enforcing logic between fields.\nNote: You need to be a\nSite Admin\nor\nProject Admin\nto configure these rules.\nAutomation is especially helpful when the QA team is reporting multiple issues in short cycles, or when bugs are created by non-technical users (like support agents or PMs). Instead of relying on everyone to fill in the same fields correctly, automation ensures consistency.\nHere are some examples of how we’ve implemented this:\n1. Auto-Assign Based on Component\nEach of our Smart Tools, like Smart Templates, Smart Checklist, has a designated module owner or dev lead. When QA selects a specific\nComponent\n, a rule triggers to assign the bug to that owner automatically.\nExample rule logic:\nIf Component = “Smart Templates” – Assign to @developer_A\nThis removes the need for QA to remember ownership or ask around. Bugs land on the right person’s radar immediately.\n2. Auto-Label Based on Issue Content\nWe use summary- and description-based triggers to apply common\nLabels\n. This makes it easier to search and filter bugs later.\nExample rule logic:\nIf Summary contains “UI” or “alignment” – Add label frontend\nIf Description includes “reported by customer” – Add label customer-report\nThese labels help categorize issues at scale and support analytics during sprint retrospectives (e.g., how many frontend bugs were created last sprint?).\n3. Notify Triage Owner on High-Priority Bugs\nSome bugs require immediate visibility. When a new issue is created with a\nMust\npriority or marked as a\nrelease-blocker\n, we send manual notifications to a triage lead (via Slack or Jira mention).\nExample rule logic:\nIf Priority = Must –  Send Slack alert to #bug-triage\nOr  Mention @triage_lead in internal comment\nThis ensures that time-sensitive issues aren’t missed — especially those that surface late in the release cycle.\n4. Append a Smart Checklist to Every Bug\nFor process consistency, we use\nSmart Checklist\nto auto-append a predefined checklist when a new bug is created. This includes required QA inputs and dev validation steps.\nExample checklist structure:\nQA Checklist:\nDescription includes steps to reproduce\nLogs or screenshots attached\nEnvironment noted\nLinked to related Story or Epic\nDev Checklist:\nBug reproduced locally\nFix committed\nPR linked and reviewed\nReady for QA testing\nThis can be applied using Smart Checklist’s Jira automation integration or manually inserted via templates.\n5. Populate Fields Based on Custom Triggers\nAdvanced teams can go beyond default rules and build sequences based on custom triggers. For instance, filling in the\nFix Version\nbased on the current sprint or applying a default\nComponent\nwhen left empty.\nHowever, as of now,\nSmart Templates\nat TitanApps are not used for pre-filling bug issue modals automatically. While this is technically possible via other apps on the Atlassian Marketplace, we keep our setup lightweight and native to Jira to avoid overcomplication.\nExample of Automation Use Cases from TitanApps Experience\nBeyond individual bug-level automation, our team also uses broader workflow and release-level automation to reduce manual work and ensure consistency across the QA and release process.\nAutomatically Mark Releases as Completed\nWhen all tickets in a release scope are done, regression is complete, and the new version is successfully published on the Atlassian Marketplace, we use an automation rule to mark the corresponding Fix Version in Jira as “Released.” At the same time, all issues associated with that version are transitioned to the\nReleased\nstatus. This eliminates the need to manually update each issue and keeps the board clean during release weeks.\nAuto-Assign Fix Version on Status Transition\nTo ensure every completed issue is correctly linked to a version, we also assign the Fix Version automatically when a ticket moves from\nIn Review\nor\nIn Progress\nto\nIn QA\nor\nDone\n. This keeps our release notes and changelogs accurate, even if the developer forgets to fill in the version manually.\nIn-Box Automation vs External Tools\nAll of the above examples are configured using Jira’s built-in automation engine (accessible via Project Settings – Automation). No third-party apps or plugins are required. This keeps our setup clean, compliant, and easy to manage across multiple projects.\nIn more complex QA environments (e.g., enterprise-scale testing), teams might use tools like Xray for test case management, which come with their own automation logic. But for straightforward bug handling like ours, native Jira rules are more than enough.\nWorkflow Validators & Conditions in Jira\nEven the best reporting standards fall apart if there’s no enforcement. At TitanApps, we use\nJira workflow validators and conditions\nto make sure no incomplete bug reports sneak into development. This ensures devs don’t waste time pinging QA for missing info, especially during critical testing or pre-release phases.\nValidators and conditions act like checkpoints between statuses in a workflow. For example, you can prevent a bug from moving from “To Do” to “In Progress” unless all core fields are filled. This removes ambiguity and encourages accountability across the team.\nThese settings are configured in the\nWorkflow Editor\n(under Jira Project Settings). You need\nadmin rights\nto change them.\nHow Validators Work\nValidators are rules applied during\ntransitions\n— they check that certain criteria are met\nbefore\nan issue is allowed to move to the next status.\nIn our bug workflow, we’ve added validators to several transitions:\nWhen moving from\n“To Do” to “In Progress”\n, we check that:\nThe\nDescription\nis not empty\nIt includes\nSteps to Reproduce\nThe\nComponent\nis selected\nA\nPriority\nis set\nWhen moving from\n“In Review” to “Ready for QA”\n, we verify that:\nThe issue is linked to a\npull request\nThe\nAssignee\nfield has changed from the developer to a QA lead\nThese checks help formalize the handover process. A dev shouldn’t mark a bug “ready” if they haven’t linked a fix. Similarly, QA shouldn’t move a bug to “Ready for Dev” if the steps to reproduce are missing or vague.\nHow Conditions Work\nConditions determine\nwho can perform a transition\n, or\nunder what circumstances\nit becomes visible. While we use them less frequently than validators, they still help streamline sensitive transitions.\nExample:\nOnly QA team members can transition a bug to “Closed.” This ensures the fix has actually been tested — not just marked “done” by a developer.\nIn some cases, we also hide transitions like “In Progress” unless a required checklist is marked complete. For this, we sometimes combine conditions with Smart Checklist’s workflow integration.\nExample: Blocking “Start Progress” if Steps Are Missing\nOne of our most effective validators prevents a bug from entering active development if the\nSteps to Reproduce\nfield is missing or incomplete. You can add this kind of validator with “Regular Expression Check” validator option.\nHere’s how it works:\nWhen a dev clicks “Start Progress,” a validator checks whether the\nDescription field\nincludes the required phrase “Steps to Reproduce”\nIf not, the transition fails, and Jira shows an error (the validator error message couldn’t be customized):\n“Field Description with actual value ‘checking validator’ does not match regular expression .Steps to Reproduce.”\nThis small rule drastically improves issue hygiene, especially when multiple teams are filing bugs in the same project.\nWhy This Matters\nIn fast-paced teams, it’s tempting to move tickets forward “just to unblock things.” But this often leads to half-baked bug reports and slows everything down.\nOnce you use validators and conditions:\nQA can’t forget required details\nDevs aren’t wasting time chasing context\nPMs get cleaner sprint reports\nEveryone knows what’s expected at each workflow stage\nThese rules create lightweight process guardrails. They don’t slow teams down, but they do prevent chaos.\nBug Lifecycle at TitanApps\nAt TitanApps, we follow a streamlined bug lifecycle that keeps our development process predictable and easy to manage without adding unnecessary complexity.\nA typical bug moves through these statuses:\nTo do > In progress > In Review > In QA > Ready for Release > Released/Done\nIn some cases, the flow may include a “Reopened” status if a fix fails verification. However, many of our teams prefer to send reopened bugs back to “To Do” or “In Progress”, depending on the dev’s availability.\nHere’s what each status means in our workflow:\nTo Do\n: Bug has been triaged and prioritized; ready for dev pickup.\nIn Progress\n: Assigned dev is actively working on the fix.\nIn Review\n: Fix is complete and under code review.\nIn QA\n: Code has passed review and is ready for verification.\nDone\n: QA has tested and verified the fix; bug is considered resolved.\nWe avoid overcomplicating this flow. For example, we don’t track “Blocked” or “Awaiting Info” statuses. Instead, we communicate blockers directly via Jira comments or Slack. The goal is to keep the board clean, make statuses meaningful, and avoid micromanaging edge cases.\nCollaboration, Communication, and Best Practices\nSmooth bug handling doesn’t stop at Jira. Its effectiveness depends much on how teams communicate and share responsibility, especially when bugs affect active sprints or production environments.\nAt TitanApps, collaboration between QA, developers, and product managers is fast and informal, but grounded in shared conventions. We don’t rely solely on issue statuses, we actually back them up with direct communication, clear summaries, and traceability.\nCritical bugs, especially those marked as “Must” or flagged during release testing, are escalated outside of Jira. QA shares these directly in dedicated Slack channels tied to each release. This ensures they’re not buried under dozens of unrelated tasks and can be addressed quickly by the dev team or triage lead.\nWhen a bug comes from the support team or customer report, QA is responsible for reproducing the issue. The support team typically provides initial context, and QA follows up to clarify steps, check logs, or test edge cases. These bugs are often high-priority, and accuracy is key. Support relies on clear summaries and consistent labels to reference issues across customer threads.\nInternally, QA and devs share a common Jira board and work closely during daily standups. Ownership is clear thanks to auto-assignment rules, but handoffs are also tracked through transitions and comments. If QA reopens a bug, they always include a comment with steps that failed and any updates to reproduction instructions.\nOur teams don’t track formal metrics like “bugs fixed per sprint” or “QA-to-dev ratio”.  Instead, we focus on whether each bug is actionable, reproducible, and relevant. That’s where consistent structure and clear expectations matter most. Whether the issue is a minor visual glitch or a release-blocking regression, everyone involved knows what quality looks like and delivers it.\nUsing Smart Templates & Smart Checklist in Bug Reporting\nWhile we don’t use Smart Templates for every bug report at TitanApps, they can be extremely helpful when you want to standardize structure, enforce quality, and speed up bug creation.\nWe recommend Smart Templates when:\nYou want all bugs to follow the same description format\nYou want to prompt users to fill in key fields (like summary or environment)\nYou want to combine a filled-out description\nand\na validation checklist\nWhen paired with\nSmart Checklist\n, your templates help enforce the process: no escalation unless all required fields and attachments are complete.\nLet’s walk through how to create a reusable bug report template using Smart Templates and Smart Checklist:Therefore, creating a bug template once, and reusing it every time when you need to log a bug into Jira is a much better option.\nHow to create a bug tracking report in Jira with Smart Templates?\nLet’s go through the steps of creating a reusable\njira bug template\n?\nStep 1: Download Smart Templates from the Atlassian Marketplace\nNone of the steps I will describe in this article are rocket science, but this one is probably the easiest. You have to\nfind the Smart Templates app on the Atlassian Marketplace and install it.\nNote\nYou need Jira Admin permissions to install apps from the marketplace. Ask your admin or PM for help during this step.\nStep 2: Create a bug template from a work item in Jira.\nOpen your Jira board and create a ticket.\nSelect the bug work type.\nCopy and paste the following text into the description field:\nSteps to reproduce\n// Please add the steps that are necessary to reproduce a bug\n1.\n2.\n…\nActual results\n// Please explain what happens when the bug is reproduced\n…\nExpected results\n// Please describe how the functionality is intended to work\nEnvironment\n// Please fill out the following:\nOperating system: {e.g. MacOS, Windows10}\nBrowser and version: {e.g. Chrome 124.0, Safari 17.4.1}\nSoftware version: {e.g. V1.51}\nEnvironment: {e.g. prod, staging, testing}\nCopy the template\nCopied\nOptimize processes with Smart Templates\nTry it free\nNote\nI prefer keeping everything in the description field for the sake of consistency. You can use the environment field in Jira to keep track of the details regarding app and browser versions, etc.\nStep 3: Save your work item as a bug report template with Smart Templates\nClick on the Smart Templates button.\nSave the structure as a new template.\nEnter the name of your template. In our case, let’s call it a Bug Report Template. Then click OK.\nYou will see a pop-up message stating that your template has been saved. Go to your template from the link in the pop-up.\nStep 4: Add text variables to your template\nTechnically, we already have a nice bug report template you can apply in one click. Still, we can make it better with text variables.\nWhile this step is optional, following through the guide till the end will make your templates much more user-friendly and easy to follow.\nWhat are text variables? These variables let users enter a certain value before applying a template. The summary field will be a great example of text variables in use. A couple of simple edits now will ensure that your QA engineers (or whoever is reporting a bug) will include a descriptive work item summary.\nOpen the Smart Templates app from the sidebar on your left.\nClick on the three dots next to the bug report template and select the Edit option.\nSelect the variables tab and add a new variable. This will be our Bug Summary.\nCopy the variable’s name, go to the Work Items Tab, and paste it into the summary field. Make sure that the name is surrounded by two sets of rounded brackets like so {{DescriptiveBugSummary}}\nClick the Save button.\nThat’s it. Now, the users will be prompted to enter a descriptive summary every time they apply the template to create a bug in your Jira instance. You can create as many variables as you need. You can also use them in the description field.\nFor example, you can add a {{StepsToReproduce}} and a {{Environment}} variable. This way, users will need to complete these fields before they can create the bug work item.\nNote\nTechnically, you can complete every step of crafting a template from the Smart Templates view. Still, I prefer to start at the work item view because applying the text formatting options inside the description field is much easier. If you don’t care about the looks – the Smart Templates option is much faster.\nStep 5: Establish and enforce a process with Smart Checklist\nThe next step in crafting a bug report template will involve a different app from our suite of Smart Tools. Like Smart Templates, you can\ninstall Smart Checklist from the Atlassian Marketplace\n.\nKeep in mind that this step is 100% optional. Still, I’d advise you to give the app a shot, as it can help you create a reliable QA process.\nWe will be relying on Smart Checklist for creating a list of ToDo’s for the QA engineer to follow. You can enforce these ToDo’s by using the mandatory Items feature. This means that the tester will not be able to move the work item further through the workflow unless the checklist items you’ve specified are complete.\nYou can read more about the functionality of mandatory items here\nFor now, the only thing that you need to keep in mind is that every checklist item that is a #MUST needs to have an exclamation point after the dash.\nMore on Smart Checklist formatting options\nOpen the Smart Templates app from the sidebar on your left.\nClick on the three dots next to the bug report template and select the Edit option.\nSelect the Smart Checklist tab on your right, under the summary field.\nCopy and paste the following text into the window and save the changes:\n-! Environment described\n-! Steps to reproduce added\n-! Actual and expected results added\n-! Logs added\n-! Video recording/Screenshots added\n- Added affected application version\nCopy the template\nCopied\nThat’s it. Now, your bug template has a ToDo checklist. Furthermore, the QA engineer will not be able to escalate the ticket to the dev team unless they’ve added the necessary attachments and completed the required details\nTo summarize, we have just created a standardized, well-formatted Jira bug template with actionable ToDo’s in under five minutes.

That includes screenshots, log files, browser version, and the actual vs expected result. The goal is to save time on debugging and make the issue reproducible for any tester or developer.\nWhat fields should I fill out in a bug report?\nAt minimum, every bug report should include:\nSummary (title)\nSteps to reproduce\nExpected result\nActual result\nAffected platform or operating system (e.g. macOS, Android)\nEnvironment (e.g. staging, production)\nPriority\nScreenshots or screen recordings\nRelated story/feature\nUsing a consistent bug report template helps ensure these are never missed.\nShould I always include screenshots or recordings?\nYes. Visuals help the team quickly understand how the bug occurs and how it affects the user experience. For UI or browser-specific issues, screenshots and screen recordings (e.g. from Chrome DevTools or your native screen recorder) are especially helpful.\nWhat if the bug isn’t always reproducible?\nFlag the issue as non-reproducible, but still log all relevant details like when and where it happened, what function was used, any error messages, and what steps you followed. Include logs, browser/OS details, and user role. This still helps with triage and future pattern recognition.\nHow can I prevent duplicate bug reports?\nUse filters and searches in your bug tracker to check for similar or related issues. Labeling issues and keeping a well-structured project (with proper components and statuses) makes it easier for testers and PMs to avoid duplicates.\nWhat tools help improve bug reporting?\nIn Jira, Smart Checklist and Smart Templates help you create and reuse structured bug templates, so no important step is missed. You can also automate part of the process — like assigning bugs or notifying stakeholders — to reduce manual effort.\nShould end users report bugs too?\nAbsolutely. End users often uncover real-world problems missed during testing. Just make sure their reports are routed through support or PMs, who can clean them up and add them to the bug backlog using your internal template.\nHow do I know if a bug is related to a vulnerability?\nIf the bug involves data exposure, security bypass, or unauthorized actions, flag it as a potential vulnerability and escalate it immediately. These are handled differently in the bug lifecycle and often require urgent attention from senior engineers or security specialists.\nIs it okay to report bugs in forums or Slack?\nFor visibility and tracking, always move any reported issue from Slack or forums into Jira using the proper workflow. Bug tracking outside of Jira often leads to missed fixes or no follow-up. You can use copy-paste templates or Slack ? Jira integrations to streamline this.\nWhen should I notify the development team directly?\nIf a bug is blocking a release or breaks critical functionality, notify the team or triage lead directly. Otherwise, Jira should be your source of truth — the team can rely on automation, mentions, and dashboards to stay updated.\nArticle by\nViktoriia Golovtseva\nContent Marketing Manager at TitanApps.

Agile developers now regularly utilize the program to monitor bugs, events, and other activities. In addition, various types of issues are tracked in JIRA by different types of organizations.\nJIRA issues may signify an assigned task, a support complaint, or a leave request form based on how your organization utilizes JIRA. Issues in JIRA are often used to represent significant features, user requests, and technological defects. Analyzing difficulties in your backlog enables you to forecast how long it takes to execute sections of the backlog.\nWhat Can Be Referred As An Issue In JIRA?\nThe term \"Issue\" refers to the general concept for the object on which you collaborate with others. When the issue type is modified to Bug, this becomes a bug. Additionally, there are task, sub-task, and feature categories. However, the advantage of JIRA is that you should set up an issue to symbolize everything which changes state and will be worked by the various people. Although it appears to be best suited for managing professional developers, it is frequently used to handle bugs, push notifications, and task requirements.\nAdditionally, you may use JIRA as an Issue Tracker; for instance, if you run the customer support, every service ticket can be considered a JIRA 'Issue'. JIRA was developed as an issue tracker, which explains the term 'Issue'.\nIn the agile environment, we typically refer to items as \"Product Backlog Items\" or \"User Stories\"; the term \"\nuser story in Jira\n\" refers to the specific style of creating Product Backlog, and the words \"Product Backlog Item\" and \"User Story\" are frequently used alternatively. However, the technologically proper way to approach this is User Story format becomes a way to express Product Backlog, and it shouldn't be constricted. A Product Backlog Issue - whether it's a Post-It Note, a JIRA Issue, or something else - is a placeholder for, or reminder for, a conversation.\nJIRA\nis a task management application that enables teams to plan, monitor, and report their work. An issue in JIRA may take the shape of a software bug, a project activity, a support complaint, or a leave request form. Thus, an \"Issue\" in JIRA is a ticket or anything you choose to label. And in JIRA, the repository for these 'Issues' is referred to as a \"Project.\"\nIn JIRA, an issue can take any form, such as a\nError in software\nThe project's objective\nA help-desk complaint\nThe leave application form\nHow to See All Issues in JIRA\nCloud and server are only relevant in terms of how you do tasks, as they use distinct codebases, which results in changes in the user interface, among other things.\nAny individual can search for issues, but they will get results from projects that allow for issue tracking. Note that you'll never see these whenever you browse for issues that are attributed to others until you have accessibility to them. This is accomplished with the use of a filter.\nRead More:\nAsana vs Jira\nDo a quick search for information\nQuick search enables you to quickly access issues, projects, newsgroups, and backlog, and also items you've worked briefly on.\nTo conduct a quick search, follow these steps\nIn the navigation bar, click Search.\nSelect from the bookmark toolbar or enter a search term.\nAlternatively, you can filter down the search results by selecting a project or issue assignee.\nChoose an item or move to the advanced issue search.\nLook for potential complications in a project\nIf you are looking for a specific issue or set of issues in JIRA work, you may use textual searching and field filters to discover them fast in the issue navigator.

Tasks, subtasks, bugs, epics, feature requests, and other types of work can be used to represent issues. Each JIRA software includes a set of predefined issue types that are appropriate for your multiple projects.\nJIRA issues are classified into three types\nJIRA Core Issue Type is associated with business initiatives.\nJIRA Software Issue Type is associated with Software project-related issues.\nJIRA Service Desk Issue Type is related to service desk operations.\nRelated Blog:\nZephyr Test Management Tool\n1. JIRA Core Issue Type\nSub-task Within an existing task, we can develop multiple tasks referred to as subtasks.\nTask A task is anything that needs to be completed for the team to attain its overall goal.\n2. JIRA Software Issue Type\nBug A bug is a failure or fault that affects a product or project's operation.\nEpic An epic is a big user story that must be split into smaller levels and is not editable or deletable once created. It is impossible to complete it in a single sprint. It will take a few months to complete.\nImprovement When we want to make changes or modifications to the specifics of an existing project, functionality, or task, we call this an improvement.\nNew feature When you wish to start a new project or task that requires development.\n3. JIRA Service Desk Issue Type\nThe term \"Service Desk Issue Type\" refers to the issue kinds associated with service desk initiatives.\nChange This Issue Type is required if you wish to make changes to the current IT profile in use.\nIT Support If you'd like some IT help, this Issue Type is demanded.\nIncidence Reporting any incident.\nNew Feature A New Feature Issue Type must add any new feature or functionality to the software.\nProblem This is required to report the primary cause of an incident.\nService Request For assistance from the administrative or internal service department.\nApproval Service Request If any help is needed requiring higher authorization.\nSupport If you require customer support assistance-related issues.\nAlso Read:\nHow to use Jira for Project Management\nJIRA Tool\nTraining Course\n2 Days of live virtual training\nView course\nHow to Categories Issues in JIRA\nWhile projects can be minor, JIRA issues are frequently significant, involving large numbers of issues.

Components JIRA project components are used to group issues. You may make reports, obtain information, and show them on dashboards using components.\n2. Versions When a version is developed, it is assigned the status \"Open\" and is added to the project's roadmap directly.\n3. Labels Labels are the most reliable choice for categorizing difficulties.

Whether you're new to Jira or want to elevate your project management game, this article dives into everything you need to know about issue types, their hierarchy, best practices, and customization.\nWhat Are Issue Types in Jira?\nIssue types in Jira are the backbone of organizing and managing work. They represent tasks, bugs, stories, or any other unit of work in your project. Each issue type carries unique properties and workflows, enabling teams to categorize and address work efficiently.\nDefault Jira Issue Types\nJira comes with a set of predefined issue types:\nEpic\n:\nrepresents large bodies of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks or stories.\nStory\n:\na user-centric requirement or feature.\nTask\n:\na generic piece of work that needs completion.\nBug\n:\nan issue that represents a problem or defect.\nSub-task\n:\na smaller, actionable piece of a larger task or story.\nCustom Issue Types\nJira also allows the creation of custom issue types to cater to unique project needs.\nExamples include:\nInitiative: a strategic objective spanning multiple epics.\nChange Request: used for tracking changes in scope.\nRisk: identifies potential risks in the project lifecycle.\nParent and Child Issues\nUnderstanding parent and child relationships in Jira is crucial for structuring work effectively.\nParent Issue\n:\nrepresents a higher-level task, such as an Epic or Task.\nChild Issue\n:\nsub-tasks or smaller work items associated with the parent issue.\nFor example, a parent issue (\"Build Landing Page\") might include child issues like \"Design mockups,\" \"Write HTML/CSS code,\" and \"Test responsiveness.\"\nWhy It Matters\n:\nthis hierarchy ensures all parts of a task are accounted for, while allowing granular tracking of progress.\nThe Anatomy of a Jira Issue\nEvery Jira issue has key components that make it actionable and traceable:\nSummary\n:\na concise title describing the issue.\nDescription\n:\ndetailed information about the issue.\nStatus\n:\ncurrent stage in the workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).\nAssignee\n:\nthe person responsible for completing the issue.\nReporter\n:\nthe person who created the issue.\nPriority\n:\nindicates urgency (e.g., Low, Medium, High).\nLinked Issues\n:\nestablishes relationships with other issues (e.g., \"blocks,\" \"is blocked by\").\nAttachments\n:\nfiles or screenshots related to the issue.\nCustom Fields\n:\nadditional fields tailored to your team’s needs.\nWhat Are Issue Type Hierarchy Levels?\nJira organizes issue types into a hierarchy, allowing teams to manage work from strategic goals to granular tasks. Here's a typical hierarchy:\nInitiative\n:\nthe highest level (customizable) representing organizational goals or themes.\nEpic\n:\na major deliverable or large body of work.\nStory/Task\n:\nindividual pieces of work contributing to the Epic.\nSub-task\n:\nspecific actions needed to complete a Story or Task.\nExample:\nInitiative: Improve User Onboarding Experience\nEpic: Redesign Registration Flow\nStory: Implement Multi-step Form\nSub-task: Design wireframes\nSub-task: Develop front-end\nHow Planyway for Jira Enhances Issue Visualization\nFor teams looking to elevate their Jira experience, the\nPlanyway\nfor Jira plugin\nis a game-changer. This tool allows you to visualize any issue type on a timeline, making it easier to track progress, plan projects, and manage team capacity. Key benefits include:\nUnified Timeline View\n:\nsee all your issues, including Epics, Stories, Tasks, and Sub-tasks, on a single timeline with a clear hierarchy, dependencies, sprint, releases, and milestones.\nTeam Capacity Management\n:\nplan workloads effectively by visualizing who’s working on what. Optimize workload with automation. Set different capacity for team mates, include vacations and apply various workload modes.\nDrag-and-Drop Simplicity\n:\nadjust timelines and schedules with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. The app fully syncs data with Jira that grants transparency.\nCross-Project Planning\n:\nmanage schedules across multiple Jira projects effortlessly.\nBest Practices for Using Jira Issue Types\nUse a Clear Hierarchy\n:\nstick to a logical structure with Epics, Stories, Tasks, and Sub-tasks.\nLeverage Custom Issue Types\n:\ndefine custom types when your project needs to deviate from standard workflows.\nAvoid Overcomplication\n:\ntoo many issue types can confuse users and dilute focus.\nUse Linked Issues Effectively\n:\nestablish relationships between issues for better context (e.g., \"blocks,\" \"duplicates,\" \"relates to\").\nAdapt Workflows for Issue Types\n:\ncreate workflows tailored to specific issue types, ensuring tasks follow appropriate statuses and transitions.\nWhat Are Linked Issues in Jira?\nLinked issues are relationships between two or more issues. These relationships provide context and dependencies, making it easier to manage complex projects. Common Jira issue link types include:\nBlocks\n:\none issue prevents another from progressing.\nRelates to\n:\nindicates a connection between issues.\nDuplicates\n:\nidentifies identical issues.\nCauses\n:\none issue results in another.\nConclusion\nMastering\nJira issue types\nis essential for streamlining workflows, managing dependencies, and achieving project goals. By leveraging issue hierarchies, linked issues, and custom types, your team can maximize productivity and maintain clarity.\nStart small by refining your default types, then experiment with custom configurations to meet your unique needs. With the right setup, Jira becomes a tool that adapts to your processes—not the other way around.\nComment\nWatch\nLike\n14 people like this\n# people\nlike this\nShare\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nCopy Link\n46919 views\n5 comments\nNicolae Victor Rusu\nRising Star\nRising Star\nRising Stars are recognized for providing high-quality answers to other users.

Instead, their implementation relies on premium features, separate Atlassian products, or apps from the Atlassian Marketplace. Here's a breakdown of the current landscape for each:\nOKRs (Objectives and Key Results)\nNatively, the standard version of Jira Cloud does not include a dedicated feature for managing OKRs. To implement OKRs within the Atlassian ecosystem, there are two primary approaches:\nJira Align\nMarketplace Apps\nBusiness Outcomes\nJira Cloud does not have a specific, out-of-the-box feature labeled \"Business Outcomes.\" Instead, the concept of tracking business outcomes is achieved by leveraging other strategic planning functionalities.\nIn essence, OKRs, Initiatives, and Epics are structured to contribute to and demonstrate the achievement of desired business outcomes. The progress of these Jira items serves as a proxy for tracking the progress toward those outcomes. Atlassian Analytics, available in premium and enterprise plans, can help visualize operational data to map output to business outcomes.[\n9\n]\nInitiatives\nThe ability to formally create and manage \"Initiatives\" as a distinct issue hierarchy level above Epics is a feature of\nJira Cloud Premium\n.\nThis is facilitated through the\nJira Plans\nfunctionality (previously known as Advanced Roadmaps).\nLike\nElena_Communardo Products\nAtlassian Partner\nAugust 27, 2025\nedited\nHi\n@Mary from Planyway\nThanks for this guide! Could you clarify how best to decide when to use a Task versus a Story, especially in cross-functional teams where responsibilities overlap?\nLike\n•\nMary from Planyway\nlikes this\nMary from Planyway\nAtlassian Partner\nAugust 27, 2025\nedited\n@Elena_Communardo Products\nIn essence, a\nStory\nfocuses on the\nwhat\nand\nwhy\nfrom a user's perspective, while a\nTask\ndetails the\nhow\nof the work required.\nThe primary determinant in deciding between a Story and a Task is the concept of user value. A\nUser Story\nis a description of a feature or functionality from the end-user's point of view. It's typically written in a simple format: \"As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit].\" This structure ensures that the development work is always tied to a tangible benefit for the user.\nA\nTask\n, on the other hand, represents a specific, often technical, piece of work that needs to be done. Tasks are the granular steps required to complete a Story. They are often defined by the team for the team and may not be written in a user-centric format.\nHere's a breakdown to guide your decision-making process:\nConsideration\nLean towards a Story if...\nLean towards a Task if...\nUser-Facing Value\nThe work directly delivers a new feature, functionality, or improvement that a user will interact with and gain value from.\nThe work is a necessary step to complete a user-facing feature but is not a feature in itself (e.g., setting up a database, refactoring code, research).\nCross-Functional Collaboration\nThe work requires collaboration from multiple team members with different skills (e.g., design, development, and testing) to be completed.\nThe work can be completed by a single individual or a pair working on a specific component.\nCompleteness\nIt represents a complete, testable slice of functionality that, once delivered, provides a sense of accomplishment and can be demonstrated.\nIt is a piece of a larger whole and, on its own, does not deliver a complete, testable piece of user functionality.\nLevel of Detail\nYou are describing the high-level goal and the \"why\" behind it, leaving the implementation details to be broken down later.\nYou are defining a specific, actionable item that needs to be performed.\nIn a cross-functional team, it's common for a single piece of user-facing work to involve multiple team members. This is where the relationship between Stories, Tasks, and Sub-tasks becomes crucial.\nBest Practice:\nCreate a\nStory\nfor the user-facing feature and then break down the work for different team members into\nSub-tasks\nwithin that Story. This approach keeps the focus on the user value delivered by the Story while providing a clear and organized way to track the contributions of individual team members\nThere are situations where creating a standalone\nTask\nis more appropriate, even in a cross-functional team:\nTechnical Debt:\nIf the team needs to address a technical issue that doesn't directly result in a new user feature, a Task is suitable. For example, \"Upgrade the database server to the latest version.\"\nNon-Functional Requirements:\nWork that supports the system but isn't a user-facing feature can be a Task. For instance, \"Set up a new testing environment.\"\nSpikes or Research:\nWhen the team needs to investigate a technical approach or a new technology, a time-boxed research Task is appropriate.\nSimple, Single-Discipline Work:\nIf a piece of work, although valuable, only involves one team member and doesn't require the collaborative effort of a full Story, a Task can be sufficient. For example, a designer creating a set of icons that will be used across the application.\nLike\n•\n2 people like this\n# people\nlike this\nElena_Communardo Products\nAtlassian Partner\nAugust 28, 2025\nedited\nThank you\n@Mary from Planyway\nso much for this very complete explanation.

But regardless of what kind of work the specific Jira issue type represents, the primary role of an issue is to grab somebody’s attention and provide them with everything they need to know to successfully complete the work.\nIn this post, we will talk about various Jira issue types across Jira products. Specifically, we will explain their structure and purpose, and also provide examples of potential use cases in the daily operations of the respective teams.\nWhat is an issue in Jira?\nIn general, an issue means\na topic or important matter\nthat you need to discuss or have in mind. Despite the common misconception, an issue is not entirely the same as a problem. Although both an issue and problem indicate something challenging, the problem additionally implies that a particular matter is unwelcome and even harmful.\nLikewise, an issue in Jira refers to\na matter that requires\nsome sort of action from a project team member. What is this action? It could be anything that must be done to move the project forward. For example, testing a new mobile app feature; writing a blog post on a specific topic; drafting a monthly report; or hiring a bricklayer for the upcoming construction project.\nSince each issue stands for\none activity\n(e.g., hiring a contractor), it makes project\nprogress tracking\neasier as you can see whether a particular piece of work is progressing as it should or not.\nJira issue types: meaning and differences\nTo accommodate the unique needs of every project and organization, Jira offers several issue types that represent different pieces of work. Each of the issue types can differ in terms of\nSet of information associated with work.\nWorkflow required for completion.\nCategory of work.\nSize of work.\nTherefore, Jira issue types not only give you all the information you need to get started but also tell you how you should proceed with an individual issue step-by-step until you complete it. In other words, you can think of an\nissue type as a template\nthat helps you categorize, describe, and put into motion an activity necessary to move the project forward.\n#1. Issue fields: a collection of information about the piece of work\nEach of the Jira issue types can hold a different set of information depending on the needs of the teams or organizations. That is possible thanks to\nJira fields that comprise issues\n. Your Jira admin can add as many fields to a specific issue as you deem suitable to your team’s specific needs.\nIssue fields provide a whole spectrum of information about an issue, covering the very issue description and assignee all the way through the start and end dates. Thanks to this, you and your team members can add and look up all the necessary information relevant to a given work whenever they\ncreate, edit, or transition an issue\n.\nAdditionally, if your project calls for a more unique piece of information that built-in fields do not cover, your Jira admin can create\ncustom fields\nfor particular Jira issue types in your project.\nA list of built-in and custom issue fields we can add to a particular issue type in the “House Build” project in BigPicture.\nThe top three fields marked with an asterisk, namely Project, Issue Type, and Summary are the default and mandatory fields that appear in every issue. They provide the core information about the work and help you and your team members quickly identify what they need to do.\n#2. Issue workflows: a structure for your work process\nJira issues also let you create a\ndifferent\nworkflow scheme\nfor every issue type\n. The workflow tells the person handling the issue what steps they need to take to successfully complete the\nwork you assigned them\n. A Jira workflow is made of a set of statuses and transitions that your individual issue moves through during its lifecycle (from start to finish).\nFor example, a very basic workflow for an issue involving writing a blog post could look like that:\nA custom Jira issue workflow tailored to the marketing team.\nWorkflows go in hand with issue types and projects. It means that you can create several workflows for the same Jira issue type but across different projects.\n#3. Standard Jira issue types: to categorize and estimate the volume of work\nEach Jira product comes with a set of\nstandard (default) issue types\nthat you can customize to match your\nmanagement methodology\n. The standard issue types are nothing more than regular business tasks. They categorize the daily work your team members need to discuss or carry out. Since the solutions Jira offers are tailored for different project types, the application-specific features (including issue types) will also differ.\nThose solutions are Jira Work Management (for business projects), Jira Software (for software projects), and Jira Service Management (for service projects). The standard issue types present in the Work Management and Software solutions follow a hierarchical structure, meaning there is a parent-child relationship between them. (We will cover\nissue hierarchy\nlater in this article.)\nJira Work Management issue types\nBy default, business projects come with one standard issue type (Task) and one child issue type (Subtask). For business teams, standard issues represent and track tasks your team members work on a daily basis.\nJira Software issue types\nIn Jira Software, you will find one parent issue type (Epic), three standard types (Bug,\nStory\n, Task), and one child issue type (Subtask). For software teams, standard issues estimate and track the effort required to build a piece of software.\nBugs, tasks, or stories?\nThe three standard issues, namely stories, tasks, and bugs are typically on the same hierarchy level. And because\ndifferent issue types stand for different categories of work\n, the difference between them lies in their usage context. Such a design of Jira issue types provides you with the flexibility you need to establish your own work taxonomy. So what certain issue types will exactly mean in your project, what information fields they will contain, and what workflow they will follow is entirely up to you.\nJira issue type hierarchy: because the size of work matters\nJira issues types are the basic units of work that must be completed. Depending on the volume of work, you can break an individual issue down into even smaller issues to make the larger piece of work more manageable. This way, you can build a hierarchical structure of work items where each issue can vary in “size.”\nCurrently, Jira supports three hierarchy levels. In BigPicture, you can have\nas many hierarchy (nesting) levels as you want\n. Typically, the hierarchical approach in Jira Software begins with epics, followed by tasks, stories, and bugs, and then by subtasks.\nA visualization of a typical hierarchy of Jira issue types in Jira Software.\nJira Service Management issue types\nThe final Jira product on our list features 8 standard issue types: Change, IT Help, Incident, New Feature, Problem, Service Request, Service Request with Approval, and Support. For service teams, standard issues represent and track different requests made by your teams and the team’s customers.\nCustom issue types in Jira\nIf none of the default Jira issue types cover the work specific to your project, a Jira admin can\nadd a custom issue type\nfor you. For your new issue type, you will need to provide the name and description and decide whether it will be a standard or a subtask issue type. Afterward, just like in the case of the default types, you can create a custom set of issue fields and workflow.\nNative issue functionalities in BigPicture: milestones and basic tasks\nBigPicture\napplication for Jira hosts a couple of issue functionalities that you will not find among standard Jira issue types. The first one lets you convert Jira standard issue type into a\nmilestone\nissue type.\nIn BigPicture, a milestone issue is displayed as a diamond on a Gantt chart. On the WBS side, it has its own distinctive icon so you can tell it from other issues. The app also lets you create a milestone issue right off the bat without the need for converting any other issue.\nA milestone issue in BigPicture that you can use for Agile, Classic, and Hybrid Jira projects.\nPlease note that you cannot directly create a\nGantt chart in Jira\nand the app does not support the milestone feature either. Therefore, the milestone you create in BigPicture (or BigGantt) will be shown as another issue type in Jira, e.g., as a story or task.\nThe second issue-related option you may find very useful is a\nbasic task\n. Unlike milestones, basic tasks exist solely in BigPicture. It means you will not see them when viewing your project in Jira. You can, however,\nconvert a basic task into a Jira issue\nand thereby make them visible in your Jira project as well.\nRight-click on a basic task to convert it to a Jira issue. You follow the same method when you want to convert a Jira issue into a milestone.\nBasic tasks have many use cases. You will find them useful when, for example, you want to quickly prototype a project structure; need a placeholder for another task; want to keep\nSprint goals\nvisible; or even structure\nSprints on a Gantt chart\n.\nRelated posts\nWhat is Jira?

Issue Types: A Comprehensive Guide\n← All articles\nThis comprehensive guide delves into the various Jira issue types, explaining their roles and best practices, to help you leverage Jira to its fullest potential, ensuring that your team remains on track and your projects run smoothly.\nWhat is an Issue?\nIn the realm of\nproject management\nand software development, an issue represents a single unit of work. This could be a Jira task, bug, feature request, or any other work item that needs to be tracked and managed. An issue helps teams document, discuss, and monitor progress on individual work items, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks.\nWhat are Jira Issue Types?\nIssue types in Jira categorize and distinguish different kinds of work. Each issue type serves a unique purpose and helps teams organize their work according to its nature and complexity. By categorizing issues, teams can manage their workflows more effectively, prioritize tasks, and ensure the right resources are allocated to the right jobs. Here are the primary issue types in Jira:\nEpic:\na large body of work that can be broken down into smaller Jira tasks or Jira stories.\nTask:\na general work item that needs to be completed.\nStory:\na user-centric feature or requirement, often written from the perspective of an end-user.\nBug:\na problem or error in the software that needs to be fixed.\nSub-task:\na smaller, more detailed piece of work that falls under a parent task or story.\nCustom Issue Type:\na specialized work item created to address unique requirements or processes not covered by standard Jira issue types.\nNow, let’s clarify the difference between Jira issue types in more detail through Jira issue type definitions:\n1.Epic\nAn Epic in Jira is a high-level issue type that represents a significant body of work, often encompassing multiple smaller tasks, stories, or even other epics. It serves as a container for related issues that contribute to a broader project objective. Typically, Epics help manage complex initiatives spanning multiple sprints or development cycles, making it easier for teams to break down large projects into manageable pieces.\nSmaller Jira issues like tasks and stories are linked to the Epic, allowing teams to track progress at both detailed and overarching levels. This hierarchical structure ensures that all work related to a specific goal is captured and aligned, facilitating better planning, execution, and\nreporting\n.\n2. Story\nA Story in Jira represents a user-centric feature or requirement that delivers value to the end-user. Stories are typically written from the user's perspective, ensuring that the work aligns with user needs and business goals, making them central to Agile methodologies focused on delivering incremental value.\nStories break down large pieces of work into manageable, actionable items that can be completed within a\nsprint\n. Each Story encapsulates a specific functionality, contributing to overall project progress. For example, a Jira story types might describe the need for a new login feature, outlining the user’s requirements and expected outcomes. Check the comparison between\nstory vs epic in Jira\nin another article.\n3. Task\nWhat is a Task in Jira? A Task in Jira is a fundamental issue type representing a distinct unit of work that needs to be completed. It typically focuses on a specific, actionable item that can be accomplished independently, making it ideal for handling routine or standalone activities.\nJira task types are useful in Agile frameworks for breaking down Stories into more manageable pieces. For example, developing a new feature might involve Tasks like writing code, designing the interface, testing, and documentation. This breakdown ensures that all components of the work are tracked and nothing is overlooked, contributing to better collaboration and project tracking.\n4. Bug\nWhat is a Bug in Jira? It is used to identify and track defects, errors, or issues in a software product that negatively impact its functionality, performance, or user experience. Bugs can vary in severity, from minor visual inconsistencies to critical failures, and are documented with details such as observed behavior, expected behavior, and steps to reproduce.\nOnce logged, Bugs are assigned to developers for investigation and resolution. In Agile environments, Bugs are often included in the sprint backlog, ensuring that fixes are integrated into the development process, maintaining a stable and functional product.\n5. Subtask\nA Subtask in Jira represents a smaller, more detailed piece of work that falls under a parent issue, such as a Task, Story, or Bug. Subtasks are used to break down complex work into manageable components, allowing teams to focus on specific aspects of a larger issue.\nSubtasks are particularly useful when a Task or Story involves multiple steps or requires input from different team members. Each Subtask is linked to its parent issue, helping track progress on individual components while monitoring the overall status of the parent Task or Story.\n6. Custom Issue Type\nA Custom Issue Type in Jira is a specialized work item created to address unique requirements or processes not covered by standard issue types. It is tailored to fit specific project needs, workflows, or industry standards, helping organizations better align Jira with their operational processes.\nIn\nService Management\n, Custom Jira Ticket Types are particularly useful for handling specific service requests or incidents. For example, an \"Access Request\" Custom Issue Type could manage employee requests for system access, with workflows tailored to reviewing, approving, and granting access. Another example is a \"Change Request,\" designed to manage proposed changes to IT infrastructure, standardizing the process and improving transparency.\nWhat are Parent and Child Issues?\nParent and child issues represent a hierarchical relationship in Jira.\nParent issues:\nThese are higher-level tasks or stories that encompass multiple sub-tasks or child issues.\nChild issues:\nThese are smaller, more detailed tasks that fall under a parent issue. Jira child issues are often used to break down the parent issue into manageable pieces.\nJira Issue Types Best Practices\nUsing Jira effectively involves adhering to best practices when managing types of issues. Here are some best practices for Jira issue types to ensure efficient project management and team collaboration:\n1. Define Clear Issue Type Hierarchies\nJira issue type hierarchy is a structured way to organize issues in a project. By default, this Jira hierarchy consists of Epics, Stories/Features, Tasks, Bugs, and Subtasks.\nBut teams can create Jira custom issue type to better align with their specific workflows and requirements. But avoid creating too many custom types that can lead to confusion.\n2. Consistent Naming Conventions\nEnsure consistent and clear naming conventions for all issues to make it easy to understand and search for related work. Use descriptive titles and summaries to provide context at a glance.\n3. Detailed Descriptions and Acceptance Criteria\nProvide detailed descriptions for each issue type in Jira  to avoid ambiguity. Include acceptance criteria for stories to define when a feature or task is considered complete.\n4. Proper Use of Labels and Components\nUtilize labels and components to categorize issues effectively, making it easier to filter and search for related Jira items. Ensure that labels and components are applied consistently across all Jira issue types.\n5. Workflow Customization\nIssue workflows define the sequence of steps an issue goes through from creation to completion. Workflows can include statuses like \"To Do,\" \"In Progress,\" \"In Review,\" and \"Done.\" These workflows ensure that issues move through a structured process, maintaining order and visibility. Always ensure transitions between states are logical and enforce required fields where necessary.\n6. Regular Grooming and Maintenance\nRegularly groom your backlog to prioritize and refine issues, ensuring that high-priority work is well-defined and ready for development. Archive or close outdated issues to keep the backlog manageable.\n7. Link Related Issues\nLinked issues are Jira issues that are related to each other in some way but do not necessarily have a parent-child relationship. They can be connected through various link types, such as \"blocks,\" \"is blocked by,\" \"duplicates,\" or \"relates to.\"\n8. Utilize Jira Agile Boards\nSet up\nAgile boards\n(Kanban, Scrum) that match your workflow to visualize and manage work in progress. Jira users often use additional specific Agile issue types above the Jira default issue type to implement Agile practices such as sprints, backlogs, and continuous delivery, allowing them to efficiently plan, track, and manage their work:\nFeature:\nA feature issue type is typically used to represent a high-level functionality that will provide significant value to the end users. It's often a part of the hierarchy that sits above user stories and tasks but below epics.\nSpike:\nA spike is an investigation or research task. It's used when there is a need to gather information or explore options before a story can be estimated or worked on.\nImprovement:\nAn improvement is an enhancement or update to an existing feature, aiming to make it better or more efficient.\nIncident:\nAn incident is an unexpected disruption or issue in the service that needs to be addressed immediately.\nChange Request:\nA change request is a formal proposal for altering a component or system, typically reviewed and approved before implementation.\n9. Effective Use of Epics\nKeep epics at a manageable size. If an epic becomes too large, consider splitting it into multiple epics. Use epic links to track the progress of related stories and tasks within the epic.\n10. Regular Reporting and Dashboards\nCreate and use Jira dashboards to monitor project progress, issue statuses, and team performance. Use built-in reports or custom queries to track metrics like burndown charts, velocity, and cycle time.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, understanding the different issue types in Jira is vital for efficient project management and effective team collaboration. Whether you're working with Jira standard issue types like tasks, stories, bugs, or more specialized types like spikes, knowing how to categorize and manage each Jira ticket ensures that your work is organized and streamlined. By grasping what an issue in Jira represents and how Jira story types and tasks function, teams can prioritize work and allocate resources more effectively.\nMoreover, understanding what a bug in Jira entails, or when to use a spike for exploratory work, allows teams to address specific needs within their workflows. With this knowledge, you'll be better equipped to use Jira to its fullest potential, ensuring your projects are managed with precision and clarity.\nAbout the Author\nVioletta Chernobuk\nis a seasoned technical writer and project management expert with extensive experience in Agile methodologies and software development processes.

The incident is attributed to OAuth scope mismatches between different internal services. Approximately 17,168 clients could be potentially affected, involving several cloud instances. The incident has resulted in 2LO permissions being incorrectly enabled, causing potential access issues. Some customers may notice unauthorized system users in their directories, which currently pose no identified security risk.\nCurrent Status\nThe short term fix involving Workspace ARI's will be rolled out cautiously over today and should resolve some highly impacted installations.\nFull restoration via backfill scripts is being developed, though this will at least take the remainder of the week to cautiously roll out to production.\nNext Steps\nThe backfill process for a permanent data correction is set to begin, with rigorous monitoring planned to observe system behavior.\nNew communication updates are scheduled to occur within the next 12 hours, or sooner if significant developments arise.\nIf you believe that you are impacted by this incident, and need assistance, then we recommend raising a support ticket.\nFeb\n16\n,\n2026\n-\n00:24\nUTC\nUpdate\n-\nOur teams identified two fix paths: a quick fix and a longer, time-consuming fix.

It’s a joy of mine to share these lessons with others through the many articles, talks, and videos I make for Atlassian\nCreate issues for free in Jira\nUse template\nJira Issues Tutorial\nIn this tutorial, we'll explain how to work with issues in Jira. Note that the team rituals you do outside Jira - like sprint planning meetings, retros, and daily standups - won't be covered here. You can read up on those in\nHow to do scrum with Jira\n.\nTIME\n10 minute read.\nAUDIENCE\nYou're new to Jira, but don't really know what to do with it\nPREREQUISITE\nYou've created a Jira account\nYou've created a Jira project\nWhat is an issue?\nIn Jira, teams use issues to track individual pieces of work that must be completed. Depending on how your team uses Jira, an issue could represent a project task, a helpdesk ticket, a leave request form, etc. In Jira, issues typically represent things like big features, user requirements, and software bugs.\nCreate an issue\nThere are a few different ways to create issues:\nFrom the top navigation bar, anywhere in Jira\nOn the backlog\nOn your board (team-managed projects only)\nOptional: Create sub-tasks\nIssues can also have sub-tasks that are assigned and tracked individually. You might create sub-tasks for any of the following reasons:\nTo split an issue into even smaller chunks\nTo allow various aspects of an issue to be assigned to different people\nTo create a to-do list for an issue\nTo create a sub-task:\nNavigate to an issue, and select\nmore\n( ••• )\n> Create Sub-Task.\nFill in the details as needed, and then click\nCreate.\nEstimate your issues (Scrum only)\nEstimating issues in your backlog helps you to predict how long portions of the backlog might take to be delivered.\nWhy estimate issues?\nEstimation is all about\nvelocity\n. The primary purpose of applying estimates backlog items is to use that information to work out how long it will take to deliver portions of the backlog.\nIn traditional development teams, managers would estimate items in 'man hours'. They could then count up the hours in the backlog, divide by the number of people on the team and hours in the week to reach a forecast date. Of course, these estimates often proved to be wildly inaccurate because they didn't take into account the natural estimation characteristics of the team (for over/under estimation), unexpected interruptions or the development of team performance over time.\nSo in the Scrum world, most teams don't try to achieve estimation accuracy; instead they aim to achieve a reliable velocity.\nVelocity\nis a measure of the number of estimation units that a team tends to complete from sprint to sprint. After their first few sprints, most teams will achieve a reasonably consistent velocity. Armed with velocity and estimates on backlog issues, teams can predict how long portions of the backlog will take to complete.\nFor example, if a team has a 'man hour' capacity of 120 hours in each sprint but a velocity of 60 hours, the 60 hour velocity can still be used to estimate the number of sprints that portions of the backlog will take to complete. It may be tempting to start wondering where 'the other 60 hours' went and implying that there's something wrong with team productivity. But that's usually got nothing to do with it: a team's estimates merely represent their view of how hard items will be, and estimates will always be affected by the team's natural behaviour (for example over/under estimation) as well as organisational overhead. The velocity is all that matters from a planning perspective.\nMost teams estimate using\nstory points.\nStory points measure the complexity of one issue relative to others. This makes sense because the main questions to be answered are 'How much work can we realistically commit to completing this sprint?' and 'How long will this part of the backlog take to deliver?'. A story point approach can deliver the answers to these questions without the anxiety around 'accuracy' that teams feel when asked to estimate in hours.\nFor more information on how estimation and velocity can be tracked,\ncheck out our burndown tutorial.\nTo set an estimate for an issue:\nEnter an estimation.\nCan I change an estimate after it has been entered?\nIn short, yes you can. But if you changine the Estimate value after a sprint has started, it'll show up as a scope change in the burndown chart.\nIf you're finding it hard to estimate issues, that's totally normal! Check out our\nestimation guide\nfor tips and tricks on finding the right estimates for your issues.\nRank your issues in order of priority\nRanking your issues in order of priority allows the team to see which issues they'll be working on next. To rank your issues, navigate to your backlog or board and click-and-drag your issues to order than based on priority. Here are some examples of where you might do this:\nIn a Scrum project\n, when planning your next sprint you might rank the issues in your backlog, and then decide to put the first 10 (or however many issues the team is capable of completing) into the sprint.\nIn a Kanban template\n, you might rank the issues in the\nTo do\ncolumn, and have team members take an issue off the top of the list when they need more work to do. With this approach, the column with all\nTo do\nissues will need constant attention as priorities shift.\nNote:\nYou must have the\nSchedule Issue\nand\nEdit Issue\npermissions for the issue you want to move higher or lower on your board.\nFlag an issue\nYou have the option to flag an issue, which look like this:\nFlagging an issue is useful because it encourages collaboration and communication throughout the team. Here are some examples:\nYou're working on a task, but realize you don't have capacity to finish it off. You can flag the issue, and a team member with spare capacity who looks at the board can jump on and help.\nAn issue you're working on becomes blocked. You can flag the issue, add a comment explaining the blocker, and move on to the next task. Anyone who looks at the board will see that it has been flagged, and understand what's going on when they open it.\nTo flag an issue:\nNavigate to your board.\nRight click an issue.\nHit\nAdd flag\n.\nTransition issues\nTransitioning issues shows progress across your workflow. To transition an issue from one column to another, drag an issue and place it in its new column.\nNote that if you find that you're not able to transition an issue into another column, it may be because the workflow for your project is restricting you from doing so. What makes Jira so powerful is that administrators can enforce certain rules on the project's workflow, like forcing bugs to go through a QA column, or not allowing Stories to go straight from To do to Done. For more information, check out our\nworkflow documentation\n.\nFilter issues\nAn issue filter allows you to hide the issues you don't want to see, and zone in on the ones you want to focus on. Jira has Quick filters, which allow you to filter the issues on your board. Here's what they look like on Scrum/Kanban boards:\nSearch bar\n: Display issues that contain a search term, and hide the rest.\nQuick filters menu\n: By default, you can filter by issues assigned to you, and issues recently updated. Any Quick filters you create will also display here.\nAssignee menu\n: Only display issues assigned to people you select.\nTo create your own Quick filters (Scrum and Kanban boards):\nGo to your board, then select\nmore (\n•••\n) > Board settings.\nClick the\nQuick Filters\ntab.\nEnter a name, JQL query, and description for the filter. For more information on JQL, check out our\nadvanced searching documentation\n.\nClick\nAdd\n.\nUsing automation as your secret weapon\nJira is the place where work lives. Sometimes a lot of work can live there! Automation is the key to keeping all issues up to date and in order.

Depending on how your team uses Jira, a work item could represent a project task, a helpdesk ticket, a leave request form, etc. In Jira, work items typically represent individual work items such as big features, user requirements, and software bugs. You can update work items to show work progress or\nadd relevant information\nsuch as who is assigned to the work, in-depth description, or attachments.\nWatch full demo\nWhat are work types?\nJira has different\nwork types\nthat can help you identify, categorize, and distinguish between different types of work. The work types out-of-the-box include:\nEpic\nRepresents a larger body of work. Epics are often represented as a collection of multiple work items.\nExample: Start a lemonade stand.\nTask\nRepresents a task that needs to be done. Tasks are used as ‘catch-alls’ and when the work cannot be accurately represented by the other work types.\nExample(s): Make lemonade. Create sign. Set-up stand.\nStory\nRepresents a requirement expressed from the perspective of the user.\nExample: As a lemonade enthusiast, I’d like to have a really cold, crisp drink.\nBug\nRepresents a problem that needs to be fixed.\nExample: The lemonade is too sour.\nSub-task\nRepresents a more granular decomposition of the work required to complete a standard work item. A sub-task can be created for all work types.\nExample: Squeeze lemons.\nSub-tasks are\nchild work items\nthat can be added after a work item has been created.\nWhat is Jira work item hierarchy?\nLet’s think about hierarchy in the context of an organization. At the top, you have your CEO. This person is supported by group of executives, who are also supported by a wider group of employees. Similarly, Jira’s work item hierarchy levels showcases how pieces of work ladder up to broader initiatives and represent different levels of detail in a plan’s scope. Jira's built-in work item hierarchy from top to bottom is as follows:\nEpics\n- Epics represent broad objectives or large bodies of work that can be broken down into stories, tasks, and bugs.\nWork items\n(task, story, bug) - Stories and tasks are work items that represent work that needs to be completed in support of those larger goals. Bugs are problems that impede the progress or functionality of work.\nSub-tasks\n- A granular piece of work required to complete a story, task, or bug.\nEach Jira product comes with these default work types, but Jira admins can create and customize work types to match any method of project management that suits your team!\nLearn more\nThere are additional levels of hierarchy above epic available in the\nPremium\nedition of Jira.\nCompare plans\nWhat is the anatomy of a work item?\nWork items capture a lot of information about a piece of work, such as assignee, due date, status, and more. In Jira, we refer to each of these elements as an\nwork item field\n. You can create a custom field to collect information that isn’t available in the default system fields.\nLearn more\nChoosing which fields appear on your team's work items, which of those fields are most important, and where those fields appear can help your team move work forward faster. The work item view's design enables great flexibility in where you place your fields. An work item’s layout can be separated into 5 key regions:\nDescription:\nSince this section is the first place users look when they open a work item, your most important fields should be configured here.\nField tabs:\nIf the work item layout's screen is configured with more than one tab, they'll show up here. Field tabs can be leveraged to organize information that may be relevant to different teams, for example.\nContext fields:\nFields above the\nhide when empty\nline in configuration appear here in the\nDetails\ngroup. Each user can pin their most important context fields into the\nPinned\nfields group depending on what works for them.\nMore fields:\nFields under\nhide when empty\nare placed in this group when they don't have a value. When they have a value, they'll appear in the Details group.\nConfigure work item layout:\nClick\nConfigure\nto change the position and visibility of fields in the work item view.\nWhat are parent and child work items?\nParent and child are terms that describe a type of relationship between work items:\nA parent work item is a work item that sits above another work item e.g. a task is made up of sub-tasks\nA child work item is a work item that sits below another work item e.g. a sub-task that belongs to a task\nThis means that the parent and child relationship isn’t limited to specific work types. Rather, any work type can be both a parent and a child work item — the only exception being subtasks, which can only be a child since there aren’t any work types below it in the hierarchy.\nWhat are linked work items?\nAs with any project, there may be dependencies between your tasks. You can easily represent this association in Jira by linking work items together.
