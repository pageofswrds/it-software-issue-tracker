Check if there's a newer version available by going to Teams settings and searching for updates.\nClear Teams Cache: Corrupted cache data can sometimes lead to crashes. Here's how to clear the cache depending on your operating system:\nWindows: Close Teams. Press the Windows key + R, type \"%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Teams\", and press Enter. Delete all the files and folders in that directory. Restart Teams.\nMac: Quit Teams. Open Finder, navigate to \"Applications/Utilities,\" and launch Terminal. Type the following command and press Enter: rm -rf ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Teams (Be cautious with this command as it deletes Teams data. Consider backing up important files beforehand). Restart Teams.\nRepair or Reinstall Teams: If clearing the cache doesn't help, try repairing or reinstalling Teams.\nWindows: Go to Settings > Apps > Apps & features. Find Microsoft Teams, click on it, and select \"Modify\" or \"Uninstall\" depending on your preference.\nMac: Drag the Teams application from Applications to Trash and empty it. Download and reinstall Teams from the official Microsoft website.\nHope this helps.\nStephen N.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2024-07-24T10:52:43+00:00\nHello Sadhvika,\nIf you're experiencing issues with the new Teams, then my suggestion will be to switch to the Classic Teams. Here's how:\nIf you'd like to switch back to classic Teams, it's easy to toggle back and forth. To switch back to the classic Teams:\nGo to Settings and more at the upper-right of Teams.\nTurn off the New Teams toggle.\nNote: If you are in a meeting or call while turning off the toggle, a notification will ask you to confirm the switch.

Even now it works with new Teams for some users.\nPlease confirm the windows version for the affected machine? - Win 10 v22H2\nCould you please confirm any pattern which is triggering Teams app crash? (e.g. calling for more some specific minutes, multi tasking on other app while on teams calls or screensharing with some specific app\\content ) - While being in a call, sharing screen over Teams, it crashes when users stop screenshare.\nDo you see any similar Teams app freezing behaviour over the web app or Teams mobile app (if using)? As of now, only reported for Teams desktop application.\nFound this in Event viewer logs.\nFaulting application name: ms-teams.exe, version: 24193.1805.3040.8975, time stamp: 0x66b14b12 Faulting

Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. We are happy to help you.\nBased on your description, I understand that you have a query \"Teams app keeps crashing\"\nHave you checked to ensure your operating system is up to date? Sometimes, system updates can resolve compatibility issues.\nOutdated graphics drivers can cause applications to crash. Have you checked for updates from your graphics card manufacturer?\nHave you tried repairing or Resetting Teams? Go to Settings > Apps > Apps & features. Find Microsoft Teams, click on it, and select Advanced options. From there, you can choose to Repair or Reset the app.\nHave you tried disabling Hardware Acceleration? Open Teams and click on your profile picture > Go to Settings > General > Uncheck Disable hardware acceleration.\nIf none of the above steps work, it might be best to create a service ticket in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This way, professional engineers can look into the issue more deeply.\nI hope one of these solutions helps! Let me know if you need further assistance. Please note that our initial response does not always resolve the issue immediately. However, with your help and more detailed information, we can work together to find a solution.

This behavior may be caused by corrupted cache files, outdated system components, or conflicts with background processes. Below are a few recommended steps to help resolve the issue:\n1. Clear Teams cache\nCorrupted cache files are a common cause of crashes.\nQuit Teams completely (right-click the icon in the system tray > Quit).\nPress Win + R , type:\n%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Teams\nDelete all files and folders inside.\nRestart your PC and relaunch Teams.\nFor more detail, you can take a look at:\nClear the Teams client cache\n.\n2. Update Teams and Windows\nTeams: Click the three-dot menu in Teams > Settings > About Teams > Check for updates.\nFor Windows: Go to Settings > Windows Update > Check for updates.\nFor MacOS: Click the Apple menu in the top-left corner > System Settings (or System Preferences on older versions) > General > Software Update. If an update is available, click Update Now or Upgrade Now. Restart your Mac after the update.\n3. Repair or reset Teams app\nGo to Settings > Apps > Installed Apps\nFind Microsoft Teams, click Advanced options\nChoose Repair first. If that doesn’t help, try Reset\n4.\nRun Teams as administrator\nRight-click the Teams shortcut > Run as administrator. This can bypass permission-related crashes.\nNote:\nPlease understand that our initial response does not always resolve the issue immediately. However, with your help and more detailed information, we can work together to find a solution.\nI hope this information is helpful. Please follow these steps and let me know if it works for you.

Teams crashing, Freezing, Video does not work, if it works it freezes, in group calls Camera goes Blank, Shared screen goes blank, Sound jittery, or does not connect to Default Mic says non supported device.  But it works for sometimes either after a Teams restart or a System restart...\nwe checked and found the Teams administrative policy states that  by 31st March all old teams versions will cease to work and auto upgrade to New Teams Crappy APP.\nbeing system admins, my team tried to uninstall the APP version and bring in classic version.. but he this is Microsoft.. with MICRO thinking and MICRO foresight, they are forcing upgrades, as soon as u install classic version it starts and gives two option.. Upgrade to new teams app now or when I am not looking.,. Err.. Working..\nBeing corporate client we raised Ticket with Microsoft.. Its been 2 weeks.. there is Radio silence... maybe their support team also using NEW TEAMS APP.. and can not either hear the other party or see their existence..\nwe are now forced to pay for Zoom subscriptions... because Teams is not working.. and not even being supported.. My IT team is frustrated... My users are frustrated...\nI have come across 1000's of posts where New Teams app is crashing and not working... But Microsoft is not even acknowledging it....\nWhy cant they allow Teams Classic to work alongside.. rather than force users...  till these BUGs are sorted... Why are they hampering the productivity Business and Subscribed users.. Why kill already working application and launch a buggy non usable app..\nNow I am turning to community... anyone has any pointers... which can make these issues go away.. resolve it to make teams working...\nMicrosoft should open the code to community they will at least support the product rather than turning deaf ears...\nAny help will be much appreciated...\nMicrosoft Teams | Microsoft Teams for business | Other\nMicrosoft Teams | Microsoft Teams for business | Other\nAdditional features, settings, or issues not covered by specific Microsoft Teams categories\nSign in to follow\nLocked Question.\nThis question was migrated from the Microsoft Support Community.

My name is Furkaan, a user just like you. I’d be happy to help you with your concern. I understand your frustration with the new Microsoft Teams app and the issues your users are experiencing. Here are some pointers that might help:\nTroubleshooting steps:\nCheck for Updates: While the update might be causing issues, ensure you're on the absolute latest version of the new Teams app. Sometimes, later updates fix bugs introduced in earlier versions.\nClear Teams Cache: Corrupted cache can cause crashes. Try clearing the Teams cache following the appropriate method for your system (\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/troubleshoot/teams-administration/clear-teams-cache).\nRepair or Reset the App: This can fix internal app issues. The repair option attempts to fix the app without deleting data, while reset wipes the app data and settings (\nhttps://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msteams/forum/all/issues-with-microsoft-teams-work-or-school-app/0d6fe8c8-1bc8-4927-9680-d725519c6bce).\nAlternative Solutions:\nWeb App: If the desktop app is causing issues, try using Teams through the web app (\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/log-in).\nDowngrade (Temporary Workaround): While not officially supported, some methods might allow a temporary downgrade to the classic Teams app. Be aware that this might not be a long-term solution and could cause further issues. Search online for instructions at your own risk.\nReaching Out:\nMicrosoft Support: While your previous attempt might not have yielded results, consider escalating the ticket or contacting support through a different channel (phone, chat).\nMicrosoft Community Forums: The Microsoft community forums are a good place to find solutions and connect with other users facing similar problems.

Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. We are happy to help you!\nI'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with Microsoft Teams.\nHave you tried resetting or clearing the Teams Cache by going Apps > Installed apps, and then type Microsoft Teams in the search box and choose Reset as in\nClear Teams cache - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn\n?\nHave you checked to ensure your internet connection is stable by visiting a few websites?\nHave you tried running the App Troubleshooter? Go to Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot > Additional troubleshooters and Select Windows Store Apps and run the troubleshooter.\nHave you tried repairing the Teams? Go to Settings > Apps > Apps & features > Find Microsoft Teams, select it, and choose Advanced options > Try the Repair option first.\nHave you checked for Windows Updates? Ensure your Windows is up to date by going to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update.\nHave you tried visiting the\nteams.microsoft.com\nand see if you can log in and use Teams from your browser?\nIf none of these steps work, let me know and we can explore other options.

The application serves as a collaboration & communication platform. Teams users have the flexibility to operate it on a desktop application or any web browser on any machine. The app is also available for Android and iOS users.\nHowever, Microsoft Teams users have reported issues when opening Teams. The application gets stuck on the loading screen and will not proceed. The loading screen raises confusion among users, leaving them with no clue what is wrong. Unless you resolve the issue, you will not be able to continue with your meetings, conferences, file sharing, task management, etc. activities.\nSince Teams is a combination of various features, it would be quite difficult to pinpoint the real culprit behind the problem. Therefore, we will consider every major reason that could trigger the Microsoft Teams not opening issue and resolve it accordingly.\nWe understand that dealing with technical problems can be quite exasperating. In this article, we will guide you through the simplest methods to resolve the “Microsoft Teams not loading” problem, ensuring you can quickly return to normal operation.\nCauses of “Microsoft Teams Not Loading” issue\nTroubleshooting begins with the initial task of pinpointing the root cause of the problem. Multiple potential factors can contribute to the Microsoft Teams not working issue, spanning from sluggish internet connections to software that is past its prime. Let’s explore some prevalent culprits:\nSlow internet connection\nA sluggish internet connection is the primary culprit behind Microsoft Teams failing to load. If you’re using a public Wi-Fi network or have an outdated router, your connection might lack the necessary strength for smooth Microsoft Teams operation. Consider switching to a different network or rebooting your router if feasible.\nOutdated software\nAnother possible cause could be that your operating system or Microsoft Teams app is outdated. Make sure both of these are up to date before trying again.\nIncompatible hardware/software\nSome hardware or software may not be compatible with Microsoft Teams, which could cause it not to load properly. Check that all components are compatible before continuing with troubleshooting steps.\nPassword change\nAnother potential source of the “Microsoft Teams Not Loading” issue is an inappropriate password change. If you have recently changed your password, it could conflict with your existing Microsoft account credentials and prevent you from logging in properly.\nIncorrect date & time settings\nThe most common cause of Microsoft Teams not loading is an incorrect date or time setting on your computer. If your system’s clock is set to the wrong time or date, or even if it’s just slightly off, it can cause issues with certain programs and applications, including Microsoft Teams.\nTroubleshooting the “Microsoft Teams Not Loading” error\nIf you rely on Microsoft Teams whether for your professional endeavors or personal needs, you’re likely familiar with the frustration that arises when the application unexpectedly ceases to function and refuses to launch. In the following discussion, we will delve into several methods, providing comprehensive guidance to fix the Microsoft Teams not working issue.\nMethod 1. Use task manager to end the Teams process\nThe first step you should take is to end the Microsoft Teams process in your computer’s Task Manager. To do this, press CTRL+ALT+DEL simultaneously and select Task Manager from the options that appear. Then, look for any processes related to Microsoft Teams and select “End Task.” After ending all these tasks, try launching Microsoft Teams again and see if the error has been resolved.\nIf this doesn’t work, then reboot your system. Restarting the operating system will close all ongoing processes, eliminating any stuck tasks related to Teams.\nMethod 2. Repair & reset Microsoft Teams\nIf your Teams app isn’t loading correctly, one of the next steps to take is to repair or reset it with the Apps & Features option from the Start Menu. To do so:\nTo repair or reset the Microsoft Teams app on Windows 10, head over to the Apps & Features page in your Start menu. Locate “Microsoft Teams” from the list of apps installed on your computer and click on it to expand its options.\nClick “Advanced Options,” then select either “Repair” or “Reset,” depending on what you want to do.\nNote:\nClick on\nRepair\nif this is your first attempt at troubleshooting the Microsoft Teams not opening issue; if not, click on\nReset\ninstead and follow through with any additional instructions provided before proceeding further.\nOnce complete, restart your computer and try launching Microsoft Teams to check if everything works as expected.\nMethod 3. Clear cache & cookies\nClearing cache files and temporary data is another useful way of resolving errors related to loading issues in applications like Microsoft teams. For this,\nOpen your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.), go to the Settings page, click on “Privacy and Security,” then select “Clear Browsing Data.”\nSelect all of the options under the Advanced tab and click “Clear Data.” This should remove any old data that may be causing issues with Microsoft Teams loading properly.\nMethod 4. Update your system\nThe next universal resolution is to try updating your system software, as an outdated system may be responsible for creating such errors. This can surely help in\nimproving Microsoft Teams performance\n.\nTo update your system software, go to\nSettings > Update & Security > Windows Update > Check for Updates.\nLet your computer check for updates and install any available ones so that your system is running on its latest version. Then restart your computer and see if the error has been resolved or not.\nMethod 5. Using SFC & DISM Scan\nIf the system is up to date, it may help to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan as well as a Deployment Image Service and Management (DISM) scan. These scans look for corrupted files or broken system files on your PC that could be causing the issue of Microsoft Teams not loading correctly.\nSelect Windows PowerShell from the Start menu.\nEnter the following command when the Windows PowerShell launches:\nsac /scannow\nTry launching Microsoft Teams once the SFC scan has finished.\nIf the Microsoft Teams still won’t load, try a DISM scan. Start PowerShell and run this command:\nDISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\nNote:\nAlways keep the\nMicrosoft Teams data backup\nbefore performing the SFC & DISM Scan.\nMethod 6. Uninstall & reinstall Microsoft Teams\nOne of the simplest & most effective solutions to fix this problem is to uninstall and reinstall Microsoft Teams. This action can often resolve any temporary issues that may be preventing your use of the program. To begin, you must first open your computer’s Control Panel and then select “Uninstall a Program” from the Programs section.\nLocate Microsoft Teams within your list of installed programs. Click on it once to select it, then proceed to click the “Uninstall” option. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the uninstallation process from your device. After successfully removing it, do the following:\nPress Win + R and type %appdata%\\Microsoft\\teams, then press Enter.\nIn the opened folder, check if, post Teams uninstallation, any related data is present & remove it.\nRestart your system, visit the official Microsoft Teams website to download and install the latest version.\nVerify if this resolves the issue.\nMethod 7. Run the Windows troubleshooter\nIf uninstalling and reinstalling don’t fix the Microsoft Teams not opening issue, running Windows Troubleshooter might help solve your problem.\nTo access Troubleshooter, go to Start, type “troubleshooting,” and select “Troubleshoot settings.”\nChoose the appropriate option according to your operating system (Windows 7/8/10) & tap on “Other troubleshooters.”\nNow, scroll down to find the Windows Store Apps. Click Run and follow the instructions provided to complete the troubleshooting process.\nOnce you have completed these steps, restart your computer, and try launching Microsoft Teams once again.\nTeams data migration as a precaution\nIf the above solutions do not provide a concrete solution to your trouble, then you can try to migrate your Teams account data and access it from another account. However, before initiating any migration job, we recommend creating backup to prevent any data loss.\nAn effective and straightforward way to migrate all Teams components with complete data is by utilizing an advanced tool, Kernel Microsoft Teams Migration. The tool provides a simple user interface, ensuring a quick migration process. It can efficiently\nmigrate Teams data from one tenant to another\nwithout tempering file/folder hierarchy and structure.\nFree Download\n100% Secure\nThis\nTeams Migration tool\noffers a secure solution for users to effortlessly duplicate or export their conversations, chats, files, and various other items with complete data integrity.

For a complete list of applicable registry keys, see\nHow Group Policy works with packaged apps - MSIX\n.\nThe following registry keys could block new Teams MSIX package installation:\nBlockNonAdminUserInstall\nAllowAllTrustedApps\nAllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense\nImportant\nIf\nAllowAllTrustedApps\nis disabled, the new Teams app (MSIX) installation fails. This issue has been fixed in the Windows October cumulative update KB5031455:\nWindows 10: October 26, 2023—KB5031445 (OS Build 19045.3636)\nWindows 11: October 26, 2023—KB5031455 (OS Build 22621.2506)\nIf this optional October update isn't available for your OS build, the November security update includes the fix.\nThese three registry keys can be found at either of the following locations:\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\AppModelUnlock\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Appx\nSome policies might change these registry keys and block app installation in your organization because of a restrictive policy that was set by the admins. Some of the known GPO policies that could prevent installation include:\nPrevent non-admin users from installing packaged Windows apps\nAllow all trusted apps to install (disabled)\nHow to check for restrictive policies for your computer\nIn Windows, search for\nEdit Group Policy\n. Or, right-click the Windows logo button, select\nRun\n, and then enter\ngpedit.msc\n.

Select the link to restart the app.\nWindows 10 users receive an error message\nWindows 10 users receive the following error message when they download and install the new Teams:\nWe've run into an issue\nTo fix this issue,\ndownload and install WebView2 Runtime\n. Then, restart the Teams desktop app and try again.\nSome people don't see the toggle to opt in\nMake sure that the user's computer meets the minimum requirements for the Teams desktop app. Then, have them sign out and back in to Teams.\nIf the toggle still doesn't appear, follow these steps:\nRight-click the Teams app icon in the taskbar, and then select\nQuit\n.\nOpen File Explorer.

Instead, a banner appears and displays the following error message:\nSomething went wrong.\nIf you check the log file for classic Teams, the following error entry is logged:\nmessage: Launch api returns false, code: 11, apiCode: undefined, extendedErrorCode: 0, launchStatus: failed, status: failure, scenario: <scenarioGUID>, scenarioName: launch_pear_app, name: launch_pear_app\nCause\nThis issue might occur for any of the following reasons:\nThe\nCookies\nand\nCache\nshell folders point to a reparse point.\nThe\nTEMP\nor\nTMP\nenvironment variables point to a reparse point.\nYou don't have the\nRead\npermission to access certain folders in the\nAppData\nfolder.\nSome folders in the\nAppData\nfolder are changed to function as reparse points.\nThe\nAppData\nfolder contains invalid files that have the same name as the required system folders.\nThe SYSTEM account and the Administrators group don't have the\nFull control\npermission to certain folders in the\nAppData\nfolder.\nYou don't have the SYSAPPID permission to the Teams installation location.\nThe\nAllowAllTrustedApps\npolicy setting prevents new Teams from starting.\nResolution\nTo apply the appropriate resolution for this issue, you have to perform multiple checks to determine the cause of the issue. There are two options to run all the necessary diagnostic checks.

However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,\nback up the registry\nbefore you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.\nCheck whether the\nCookies\nand\nCache\nshell folders point to a location that is a reparse point:\nRun the following PowerShell commands:\n(gp ([environment]::getfolderpath(\"Cookies\"))).Attributes -match 'ReparsePoint'\n(gp ([environment]::getfolderpath(\"InternetCache\"))).Attributes -match 'ReparsePoint'\nIf both commands return\nFalse\n, go to step 2. Otherwise, open the Registry Editor and locate the following subkey:\nComputer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\User Shell Folders\nFor the shell folder in the PowerShell command that's returned as\nTrue\n, update the value of its associated registry entry to a location that isn't a reparse point. For example, you can set the value to the default path:\nRegistry entry\nValue\nCookies\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCookies\nCache\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\nCheck whether the values of the\nTEMP\nor\nTMP\nenvironment variables are set to a reparse point:\nRun the following PowerShell command:\ngci env:* | ?{@(\"TEMP\", \"TMP\").Contains($_.Name)} | %{$_.Value+\" - \"+((gp $_.Value).Attributes -match 'ReparsePoint')}\nIf the command returns\nFalse\n, go to step 3. Otherwise,\nset\nthe value of the environment variables to a location that isn't a reparse point.\nCheck whether you have the\nRead\npermission to access all the following directories in the\nAppData\nfolder:\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\History\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\History\\Low\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\History\\Low\\History.IE5\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\IECompatCache\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\IECompatCache\\Low\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\IECompatUaCache\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\IECompatUaCache\\Low\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCookies\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCookies\\DNTException\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCookies\\DNTException\\Low\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCookies\\Low\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCookies\\PrivacIE\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCookies\\PrivacIE\\Low\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PPBCompatCache\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PPBCompatCache\\Low\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PPBCompatUaCache\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PPBCompatUaCache\\Low\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\VirtualizationTests.Main_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalCache\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Publishers\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Publishers\\8wekyb3d8bbwe\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Microsoft\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\DOMStore\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\EdpDomStore\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\EmieSiteList\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\EmieUserList\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\IEFlipAheadCache\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Crypto\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\UserData\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\UserData\\Low\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Spelling\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Libraries\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\nYou can use the\nTest-Path\nPowerShell command to perform this check. If you don't have the\nRead\npermission for a particular folder, ask someone who has the\nFull control\npermission for the folder to grant you the\nRead\npermission.\nCheck whether any of the folders that are listed in step 3 are changed to function as reparse points. If any of the folders are reparse points, contact\nMicrosoft Support\n.\nCheck for files that have the same name as a required system folder in the\nAppData\nfolder. For example, a file that's named\nLibraries\nin the path,\n%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Libraries\n, has the same name as a folder that has the same path. For each folder that's listed in step 3, run the following PowerShell command:\nTest-Path -Path <directory name, such as $env:USERPROFILE\\AppData\\Local\\Temp>  -PathType Leaf\nIf the command returns\nTrue\n, remove the file, and then create a folder by using the same name as the complete path for the system folder.\nCheck whether the SYSTEM account and the Administrators group have the\nFull control\npermission to all directories that are listed in step 3.\nRun the following PowerShell commands for each folder:\n((Get-Acl (Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE \"<directory name that starts with AppData, such as AppData\\Local>\")).Access | ?{$_.IdentityReference -eq \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" -and $_.FileSystemRights -eq \"FullControl\"} | measure).Count -eq 1\n((Get-Acl (Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE \"<directory name that starts with AppData, such as AppData\\Local>\")).Access | ?{$_.IdentityReference -eq \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" -and $_.FileSystemRights -eq \"FullControl\"} | measure).Count -eq 1\nIf either command returns\nFalse\n, ask someone who has the\nFull control\npermission for the folder to grant the\nFull control\npermission to the corresponding account.\nCheck whether you have the SYSAPPID permission to the Teams installation location. Run the following PowerShell command:\nGet-AppxPackage MSTeams | %{$_.InstallLocation+\" - \"+(((Get-Acl $_.InstallLocation).sddl -split \"\\(\" | ?{$_ -match \"WIN:/\\/\\SYSAPPID\"} | Measure).count -eq 1)}\nIf the command returns\nFalse\n, ask a member of the local Administrators group to\ndelete your user profile\non the computer. Then, sign in by using your user account to re-create the user profile.\nCheck the\nAllowAllTrustedApps\npolicy setting:\nIn a Command Prompt window, run the\nwinver\ncommand.\nCompare your Windows version and build number in the results to the following versions of Windows 11 and Windows 10:\nWindows 11 version 21H2 OS build 22000.2777\nWindows 11 version 22H2 OS build 22621.2506\nWindows 10 version 21H2 OS build 19044.4046\nWindows 10 version 22H2 OS build 19045.3636\nIf your Windows version and build number are earlier than those in the list, open Registry Editor, and then locate the\nAllowAllTrustedApps\nregistry entry under one of the following subkeys:\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\AppModelUnlock\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Appx\nCheck the value of\nAllowAllTrustedApps\n. If the value is\n0\n, the policy is disabled. Change it to\n1\nto enable the policy, and then try again to start new Teams.\nNote:\nTo start new Teams without enabling the\nAllowAllTrustedApps\npolicy, you must be running one of the versions of

These tools can cause the app to crash. You may need to include or approve the Teams app in these applications.\nClear Cache\n: You can try clearing the Teams cache. To do this, open Terminal and run the following commands:\nrm -rf ~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.com.microsoft.teams\nrm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.teams2\nUpdate Drivers\n: Make sure that your audio and video drivers are updated, as outdated drivers can lead to performance issues with Teams.\nEnable Windows Error Reporting (WER)\n: This can help identify the root cause of the issue and report it to Microsoft.\nCheck Teams Client Health\n: If the issue persists, you can check the Teams client health dashboard for insights on why the app might be crashing. This can provide potential reasons and resolutions for the problem.\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to\nMicrosoft Support\nfor further assistance.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nSign in to comment\nAdd comment\nWinnie-B\n•\n5,595\nReputation points\n•\nMicrosoft External Staff\n•\nModerator\n2026-02-05T04:06:45.78+00:00\nHi\nOANA TEPES GREURUS\nThank you for reaching out to Microsoft Q&A Forum. I understand that Microsoft Teams keeps crashing on your Mac, I know how frustrating that can be, especially after reinstalling the app.\nI can see a Q&A Assist reply under your post. To avoid repeating it, could you tell me whether you’ve tried those steps yet, and what happens when you try?\nTo help me guide you better, can you also confirm:\nYour macOS version\nThe exact Teams version you're using\nWhether Teams crashes before you see the sign-in screen or after you sign in\nIn addition, please try these steps:\n1. Use Teams on the web (temporary workaround)\nGo to\nhttps://teams.live.com\nSign in and use Teams in any browser (Safari, Chrome, or Edge)\n2. Make sure your macOS is supported\nTeams for macOS supports one of the three most recent macOS versions. If your Mac is on an older version, Teams can crash on launch. You can see\nSystem requirements for Microsoft Teams Free - Microsoft Support\n3. Clear Teams local cache\nA “quit unexpectedly” crash is commonly caused by corrupted local Teams data. Please fully quit Teams, then clear the cache using the official Microsoft steps here:\nClear the Teams client cache - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn\nIf you try the steps above and still experience the crash, please let me know so I can guide you further. Thank you for your time and understanding.\nIf the answer is helpful, please click\n\"Accept Answer\"\nand kindly upvote it.

Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Q&A forum!\nI sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you’ve experienced. I truly appreciate your patience during this time and thank you for bearing with us.\nCurrently, I’ve noticed that many users are experiencing the same issue when using Microsoft Teams version 25332. To resolve this problem more quickly and effectively, I recommend submitting a problem report directly within Teams so that the product team can review and address it as soon as possible. This will help the Teams product team diagnose and fix the issue faster.\nIn Microsoft Teams, click the Settings and more (…) button in the upper-right corner.\nHover over Feedback.\nSelect Report a problem.\nA feedback window will appear.\nChoose the appropriate category, describe the issue, and attach screenshots or logs if needed.\nIndicate whether Microsoft can contact you regarding your feedback.\nClick Submit.\nAdditionally, I have found a temporary solution shared by another user who experienced the same issue. This workaround has been tested successfully. You may try it and verify if it works for you\nWhen Teams crashes again, run Command Prompt as an administrator, then execute:\nnetsh winsock reset\nAfter completing the command, restart the system. Teams no longer crashes.\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me. Your understanding and co-operation are highly appreciated. I am looking forward to your response.\nWishing you a wonderful day ahead!\nIf the answer is helpful, please click \"\nAccept\nAnswer\n\" and kindly upvote it.

The software is often sluggish, lagging behind my inputs, and making real-time collaboration a challenge. Frequent crashes and unexpected sign-outs disrupt my workflow and necessitate constant sign-ins.\nThe user interface feels cluttered and unintuitive, causing difficulty in locating simple functions. Although Teams promises integration with the rest of the Microsoft 365 suite, this integration often feels clunky, leading to confusion and productivity loss.\nVideo call quality has been inconsistent and has led to miscommunication in meetings. Plus, managing large group chats can be an ordeal with messages easily getting lost in the flood. It seems like Teams is not fully optimized for handling heavy traffic.\nI'd like to ask the community, have you also experienced these problems? Are there any workarounds or fixes that have worked for you? Could this be an issue at my organization's end? Is there something I'm not doing right, or is Microsoft Teams truly a flawed platform?\nAny thoughts, insights, or suggestions are greatly appreciated!\nNOTE: My intention is not to bash Microsoft Teams or discourage its use, but to better understand the problems and ideally find solutions. If you've had a positive experience with Teams, I'd love to hear about that as well.

When you go to the admin center, click on \"Show more\" >  \"Health\" on the left.  Make sure you click  on \"issue history\" for those in the past that have been restored now.  The one on the July 10th is TM635782, but TM642420 can be related to your issue as well.\nAnother good place to find incident/outage information is via the MSFT365Status account on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/MSFT365Status\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\n9 additional answers\nSort by:\nMost helpful\nMost helpful\nNewest\nOldest\nAnonymous\n2023-07-12T08:57:45+00:00\nHi Arif,\nwhat I was asking is where did you see the outage you refer to here:\n\"Yes, as I checked in the last 24 hours, there were some reported MS Teams outages.\"\nI can only see an outage regarding picture uploaded and that was not an issue I experienced.\nthank you\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2023-07-12T01:07:24+00:00\nDear Azure,\nThank you so much for your reply!\nCould you please confirm where you are experiencing the issue while uploading pictures?\nWhen you upload the picture, do you receive an exact error message?\nWhat steps have you taken to fix this issue?\nHave you tried using MS Teams on the web?

My name is Arif, and I will assist you today.\nYes, as I checked in the last 24 hours, there were some reported MS Teams outages. From the admin portal, you can check the Microsoft 365 Service Health console to review the service health.

In this situation, the Teams client is unable to load.\nTo resolve this issue, update your browser settings by using the steps in the appropriate section.\nNote\nYou must have administrative rights to make the updates. If you're the administrator for your organization, you can use a Group Policy Object (GPO) to make the updates simultaneously for all users.\nMicrosoft recommends that you block third-party cookies from your browser.

Verify which type you can use on your network. The templates show which registry keys you can set to configure Chrome and what the acceptable values are. Chrome accesses the values that are set in these registry keys to determine how to act.\nDownload\nChrome administrative template\n.\nOpen Group Policy editor by navigating to\nStart > Run: gpedit.msc\n.\nNavigate to\nLocal Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates\n.\nRight-click\nAdministrative Templates\n, and select\nAdd/Remove Templates\n.\nAdd the\nchrome.adm\ntemplate through the dialog box.

If you add the ADM template on Windows 10 or 7, the folder appears under\nClassic Administrative Templates\n/\nGoogle\n/\nGoogle Chrome\n.\nConfigure policies by opening the template that you just added, and then change the configuration settings. The most commonly modified policies are:\nSet the home page\n: The URL that Chrome opens when a user opens the browser or selects the\nHome\nbutton.\nSend anonymous usage statistics and crash information\n: To turn off sending any crash information or anonymous statistics to Google, change this setting to\nFalse\n.\nTurn off auto-updates\n: Although we don't usually recommended it, you can turn off auto-updates.\nApply the policies to the target computers. Depending on your network configuration, the policy might require some time to propagate. Or, you might have to propagate the policies manually through the administrator tools.\nAdd the sites that are listed in step 2 under\nMicrosoft Edge\nto the\nContent settings\n>\nCookiesAllowedForUrls\nsetting.\nFor more information, see\nSet Chrome Browser policies on managed PCs\n.\nYou can also download the templates separately and view common policy documentation for all operating systems by referring to\nZip file of Google Chrome templates and documentation\nMozilla Firefox\nIn the Firefox\nSettings\nwindow, select the\nPrivacy & Security\ntab.\nUnder\nCookies and Site Data\n, select\nManage Exceptions\n.\nIn the\nAddress of website\ntext box, enter the following URLs, and then select\nAllow\n:\nhttps://microsoft.com\nhttps://microsoftonline.com\nhttps://teams.skype.com\nhttps://teams.microsoft.com\nhttps://sfbassets.com\nhttps://skypeforbusiness.com\nSelect\nSave Changes\n.\nTo change the settings by using a GPO:\nDownload and install\nthe Firefox administrative template\n.\nAdd the sites that are listed under \"Microsoft Edge\" to\nCookies\n>\nAllowed Sites\n.\nFor more information, see\nCustomizing Firefox Using Group Policy\n.\nSafari\nTeams support for Safari is currently in preview.

This started 5 days ago. Event viewer shows the app crashed. Did a repair on the Teams app which didn't fix the issue. Uninstalled and deleted the contents from the Teams folder under appdata\\Roaming. Downloaded the Teams software from the online Teams site, ran the exe installer ... but it didn't go through a typical install prompt, only opened Teams and then crashed.\nWhat did install, doesn't have the purple icon, its a solid blue. Ran SFC and it found some issues, rebooted but Teams still crashes. Video card drivers are current. Our antivirus is Defender.\nNot sure what to look at next. Running the online version of Teams from 365 site does work okay.\nMicrosoft Teams | Development\nMicrosoft Teams | Development\nBuilding, integrating, or customizing apps and workflows within Microsoft Teams using developer tools and APIs\nSign in to follow\nSign in to follow\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nI have the same question\nI have the same question\n2\n{count} votes\nSign in to comment\nAdd comment\n2 answers\nSort by:\nMost helpful\nMost helpful\nNewest\nOldest\nAustin-H\n•\n7,690\nReputation points\n•\nMicrosoft External Staff\n•\nModerator\n2025-05-28T01:55:02.0066667+00:00\nDear\n@PHarris\n,\nThank you for contacting Microsoft Q&A Support.\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused to your work. Based on your detailed description, it appears that the new Microsoft Teams desktop client is experiencing stability issues on Windows 11, which have been affecting multiple users following recent updates.\nWhile we appreciate the troubleshooting steps you have already taken, including repairing, reinstalling, and clearing application data, this issue may involve deeper system-level or application-specific conflicts. Given the evolving nature of the new Teams client, there are still areas under active development and improvement. At this time, we recommend continuing to use the web version of Teams at\nhttps://teams.microsoft.com\n, which remains stable and fully functional.\nBesides that, you maybe try to install Microsoft Teams version from Microsoft Store to see if it still crashes.\nAlso, for the urgent scenario. We have one more suggestion that you could create a new Windows profile.\nGo to Settings > Accounts.\nClick on the Family & other users option.\nClick on Add account button.\nThere are two options:   Microsoft account: Log in your Microsoft account.  Offline account: Create a new local account (Fill in username, password, and password hint)\nYou can set up role for the new profile (Administrator or Standard User)\nThen you can try signing into Microsoft Teams again.\nAdditionally, due to the complexity of the issue and the limitations of support available through the Q&A forum, we kindly suggest that you escalate this matter by submitting a service request through the\nMicrosoft 365 Admin Center\nfor the most efficient helps. This will allow our dedicated support engineers—who have broader diagnostic tools and permissions—to investigate and assist you more effectively.\nNote: If you do not have administrative access, please contact your organization’s Microsoft 365 administrator to initiate the support request on your behalf.\nOnce again, I thank you for your understanding and patience in this matter.\nWish you all the best.\nIf the answer is helpful, please click\n\"Accept Answer\"\nand kindly upvote it. If you have extra questions about this answer, please click \"Comment\".\nNote: Please follow the steps in\nour documentation\nto enable e-mail notifications if you want to receive the related email notification for this thread.\n2 comments\nShow comments for this answer\nReport a concern\nAustin-H\n•\n7,690\nReputation points\n•\nMicrosoft External Staff\n•\nModerator\n2025-05-29T02:26:26.1633333+00:00\nHi\n@PHarris\n,\nMay I know that I have a chance to have a check of my suggestions with your Team Desktop client?\nIf you have any further updates or require additional assistance, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Also, try running Teams as administrator and temporarily disable Defender real-time protection to rule out conflicts. Consider doing a clean boot to eliminate startup program interference. Installing Teams via the MSI installer instead of the EXE can sometimes help, and testing the Teams Public Preview version is worth a shot. Make sure Windows is fully updated, and check Event Viewer crash details for clues about faulty modules or errors.\n1 comment\nShow comments for this answer\nReport a

Normally, it will simply crash and restart in a loop for a random number of times before it stays running. Running Teams as Admin seems to shorten the cycle but not resolve it.\nAs of last week, I am unable to join a live or scheduled Teams call at all. I receive the \"select devices\" prompts to join but when I click join or transfer to this device, the session immediately crashes. I pulled the event viewer logs and this log is created during each crash:\nCritical Error Log:\nFaulting application name: ms-teams.exe, version: 26005.204.4249.1621, time stamp: 0x69616fc8\nFaulting module name: MMDevAPI.DLL, version: 10.0.26100.7309, time stamp: 0xca623a80\nException code: 0xc0000005\nFault offset: 0x0000000000052da6\nFaulting process id: 0x1CB0\nFaulting application start time: 0x1DC896ED5D35B13\nFaulting application path: C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps\\MSTeams_26005.204.4249.1621_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\\ms-teams.exe\nFaulting module path: C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\MMDevAPI.DLL\nReport Id: 05eaad7b-6698-474c-bc3a-f83560911a37\nFaulting package full name: MSTeams_26005.204.4249.1621_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\nFaulting package-relative application ID: MSTeams\nInformation Log:\nFault bucket 2134386592934741119, type 5\nEvent Name: MoBEX\nResponse: Not available\nCab Id: 0\nProblem signature:\nP1: MSTeams_26005.204.4249.1621_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\nP2: praid:MSTeams\nP3: 26005.204.4249.1621\nP4: 69616fc8\nP5: StackHash_3c61\nP6: 0.0.0.0\nP7: 00000000\nP8: PCH_FE_FROM_unknown+0x0000000000000000\nP9: c0000409\nP10: 000000000000000a\nAnalysis symbol:\nRechecking for solution: 0\nReport Id: a0fde5a8-31b4-4778-bf35-bb4b788d5643\nReport Status: 268435456\nHashed bucket: fceb719e047772cb9d9edd4c3d3b447f\nCab Guid: 0\nEvery driver in my system is up to date and I've optimized Teams as much as I know how to do.

I found a ton of errant files left over after I uninstalled. Once I manually hunted down and deleted all of those files in the entirety of the AppData folder, not just in the AppData/Teams folder, I was able to reinstall Teams and it is now working again.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nSign in to comment\nAdd comment\n5 additional answers\nSort by:\nMost helpful\nMost helpful\nNewest\nOldest\nEG\n•\n5\nReputation points\n2026-01-19T21:44:45.01+00:00\nVery good to know what this specific driver does. I tried changing devices and it didn't help. I have Teams working again, but to get it there I had to uninstall it completely and then manually seek out and delete probably 15 or 20 files and folders that were left behind in the AppData folder after I uninstalled the application. There were bits and pieces everywhere but once they were all gone, I reinstalled Teams and it finally works again.\nThank you for your help on this. I'm not sure what remnant in those folders was causing this problem but hopefully this won't happen again.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nSign in to comment\nAdd comment\nRuwim.B\n•\n5,665\nReputation points\n•\nVolunteer Moderator\n2026-01-19T20:27:32.5566667+00:00\nThe issue might be with the Onkyo CR265 Bluetooth device.\nWhat happens when you make the Test call?\n1 comment\nShow comments for this answer\nReport a concern\nEG\n•\n5\nReputation points\n2026-01-19T20:35:38.9133333+00:00\nIt just crashes. Several of the logged crashes in the attached log file are attempted test calls.

My speaker is an Onkyo CR265 tuner linked via bluetooth. I'm not using any other devices and I am not using any supplementary software.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the problem:\nCheck for Conflicting Software\n: Sometimes, third-party applications, especially VPNs or antivirus software, can interfere with Teams. If you have any such applications running (like Astrill), try disabling or uninstalling them to see if that resolves the issue.\nClear Teams Cache\n: Clearing the cache can help resolve many issues. You can do this by navigating to\n%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Teams\nand deleting the contents of the folder. Restart Teams afterward.\nRepair or Reset Teams\n: You can try repairing or resetting Teams through the Settings app. Go to\nSettings > Apps > Apps & features\n, find Microsoft Teams, and select\nRepair\nor\nReset\n.\nUpdate Drivers\n: Ensure that your audio and video drivers are up to date. Outdated drivers can cause compatibility issues with Teams.\nCheck Event Viewer Logs\n: Since you've already pulled the Event Viewer logs, look for any patterns or additional errors that might give clues about what's causing the crashes. The error related to\nMMDevAPI.DLL\nindicates a potential issue with audio devices. Ensure that your audio devices are functioning correctly and are properly configured.\nReinstall Teams\n: If none of the above steps work, consider uninstalling Teams completely and then reinstalling it. Make sure to download the latest version from the official Microsoft website.\nContact Microsoft Support\n: If the problem persists, it may be beneficial to reach out to Microsoft Support for further

I'm using the desktop version and have also tried using my Teams on x2 Surface Pros and having the SAME issues!! Whenever I'm in a call/meeting, I keep freezing and then approx 11 minutes in, bang, not responding, and my screen goes blank.\nThis is so frustrating. My IT dept has been on my machine for nearly 3 days trying different ways. I've seen that many people have the same complaint - please tell me Microsoft is working hard to fix this immediately!\nI can't work like this! Please help!\nThanks\nVicky\nMicrosoft Teams | Microsoft Teams for business | Other\nMicrosoft Teams | Microsoft Teams for business | Other\nAdditional features, settings, or issues not covered by specific Microsoft Teams categories\nSign in to follow\nLocked Question.\nThis question was migrated from the Microsoft Support Community.

I found out why.\nIt is when the Microsoft Link USB is installed (in my case used with a microsoft headset). Every time when i start teams (new edition, school or work version) then usb link ligths up (flashes white light) when its done flashing and i want to post a message, teams is lagging and crashes.. Closing the app then is possible but it is directly reopening.\nWhen i disconnect the usb link and start team and using the headphone by bluetooth it works fine.\nIt is since this morning, yesterday it worked perfectly; and i haven't installed anything new (no windows updates either).\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2023-12-27T03:15:34+00:00\nIve tried all the above items on the list and my New Teams installation still closes after about 5 seconds.   This is on a PC that other profiles exist and I believe the other profiles that use this machine regularly are not having the same issue.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2024-01-30T08:37:43+00:00\nHello,\nI'm experiencing a similar bug with the Microsoft Teams desktop App on a Surface Pro 8.\nAfter a while into the meeting, my camera starts to freeze. I tried uninstalling/reinstalling the app, but that doesn't change anything.\nIt even happens sometimes that when I want to connect to a meeting, my camera and my microphone are grayed out on the application.\nEven though I close the application with the task manager and reopen it, it doesn't work. The only solution I found is to restart the PC.\nIf anyone finds a solution, that would be great!\nSincerely,  Jérôme\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2023-11-21T15:48:07+00:00\nHello Vicky S,\nI'm Segunfunmi, an Independent Advisor and Microsoft user like you. Thank you for posting your query in this forum.\nI'm sorry you're having some trouble with Microsoft Teams. Don't worry; I'm here to help! Here are a few suggestions that might do the trick:\nClear Microsoft Teams Cache: Sometimes, clearing the cache can help fix application issues. To do this, end all Teams-related services running in the Task Manager.\nRepair or Reset the App: You can also try repairing or resetting the Teams app. To do this, open Settings > Apps > Apps and features and locate Microsoft Teams in the Apps list. Click on the three dots > Advanced options. There, you will see the buttons to repair or reset the app.\nReinstall Microsoft Teams: If the above steps don't work, you might need to reinstall Teams. To do this, uninstall the Teams app in programs and features, then go to %Appdata%\\Microsoft\\ (type %Appdata%\\Microsoft\\ on Run or File Explorer) and delete the Teams folder. Finally, you can reinstall the MS Teams app again by downloading the app from the official site.\nUpdate Teams: Ensure you're running the latest Teams version. You can check for updates by going to the Teams folder (%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Teams) and running Update.exe.\nCheck Task Manager: If Teams is crashing, open the Task Manager (press Win + R, type taskmgr, and click OK), look for any tasks associated with Microsoft Teams, select the process, and click End task.\nI hope these suggestions help you get back on track with Microsoft Teams.

While Teams is definitely one of the best platforms out there for communication, collaboration, and productivity, it’s subject to the same technical problems and occasional bugs as any software.\nSometimes, issues are caused by something going wrong on Microsoft’s side. Plenty of times, people lose access to certain features or\nthe entire app\nbecause of a fault they can’t control. However, there are also issues that you might be able to troubleshoot and fix yourself.\nSince I know firsthand just how important Microsoft Teams is to keeping the workplace operating smoothly, I’ve created this guide. Here, I’ll cover some of the most common Microsoft Teams issues (and how to fix them), as well as some top tips for addressing a range of Teams problems.\nThe First Step: Checking if Microsoft Teams is Down\nBefore you waste any time troubleshooting Microsoft Teams issues, it’s worth checking if there’s an outage stopping you from using the app or certain features. If MS Teams is down, there’s probably nothing you can do but wait for the company to fix the issue itself.\nThere are a few ways you can\ncheck if an outage is happening\n:\nCheck the status of all\nMicrosoft products on this website\n.\nUse the Microsoft Teams or Microsoft 365 Admin Center to check “service health” for your apps. Log into your admin centre, click “Health”, then “Service Health”.\nMonitor the\nMicrosoft Teams Twitter (X) account\nfor service issue updates, or look for the #MicrosoftTeams hashtag.\nThere are also plenty of handy websites out there where users can submit information about Microsoft Teams issues for others to review, like Downdetector. I’d also recommend asking your colleagues if they’re encountering the same issues as you. This should help you identify if there’s a problem with the client or your specific Teams experience.\nFixing Common Microsoft Teams Issues\nAssuming Microsoft Teams appears to be working as it should (at least for most people), there are various ways to troubleshoot and fix common problems. Here are some of the most common problems I see Microsoft Teams users encountering and how you can fix them.\nProblem: New Microsoft Teams Issues\nThe\nnew version of Microsoft Teams\nis the upgraded, higher-performing version of the previous client, rebuilt from the ground up. Though this version of Teams is likely to be much better for users in the long term, some companies in the early stages of transitioning to New Teams have experienced a handful of problems. Common issues include:\nMissing or unavailable features.\nThe app crashes when a user hits the “Create” button in the Team creation wizard.\nCross-Cloud Guest Access accounts don’t show on the web client.\nWebsites don’t load in the new Teams desktop\nVideo doesn’t render correctly\nIf you can’t find the same features you used in the classic version of Microsoft Teams, they may have changed or might be removed from the client. You can see a list of\ndifferences between the versions here\n. One point worth remembering is that New Microsoft Teams doesn’t support Windows notifications, so if you’re not seeing notifications on Windows, that’s probably why.\nIf you’re struggling with crashes or videos not loading properly, I’d recommend quitting out of the app and restarting it to refresh the client. Alternatively, speak to your administrator about the issues you’re facing or contact Microsoft directly.\nProblem: New Messages and Threads Aren’t Showing\nIf your feed appears to be frozen in time, or you’re receiving new messages on the mobile version of Teams but not the desktop app or web version, you have a few options. If you’re using the web version of Teams, simply refresh the page.\nI find I lose access to new messages when I’m automatically logged out of Teams without realising it. If you’ve been logged out, refreshing the page will prompt Microsoft to ask you to sign in again, which should fix the issue. If you’re experiencing the same Microsoft Teams issue on the desktop app, restart the app.\nYou can do this on Windows by right-clicking on the Teams icon in your taskbar and selecting quit.\nOn a Mac device\n, right-click the icon in your dock, select “quit”, then re-open the app. If the problem persists, check your internet connection. If your connection is slow or isn’t working properly, this can stop Microsoft Teams from working correctly.\nProblem: Microsoft Teams Issues with Microphones and Webcams\nIf your Microsoft Teams issues revolve around problems with your\nwebcam or microphone\nduring meetings, start by checking your hardware. Make sure everything is plugged in correctly, and make sure you have your microphone and camera options toggled “on” in your meetings.\nIf other applications seem to connect with your devices without a problem, but Microsoft Teams doesn’t, this could be a permissions issue. To alter permissions on a Windows computer, go to the search bar, type in “webcam”, and select “Choose which apps can access your camera”. Ensure the options for “desktop apps” and “web browsers” are switched on.\nOn a Mac device, click the Apple icon in the upper left of the screen, then go to “Systems Preferences” followed by “Security & Privacy.” Choose the “Camera” option, and ensure Teams and your web browser have access to your camera.\nYou can also change permissions on most smartphones to ensure Microsoft Teams can access your camera and microphone by going into the “Apps” or “Settings” section of your phone.\nIf this strategy doesn’t work, try:\nUpdating Microsoft Teams:\nClick the “More Options” (…) button on Teams, next to your profile icon, and select “check for updates”.\nChecking you’re not using your devices elsewhere:\nMake sure you’re not already using your microphone or camera for another app.\nMaking a test call:\nClick the “More Options” (…) button, then click on “Settings”, then “Devices”, followed by “\nMake a test call\n”.\nProblem: Unable to Create a New Team in Microsoft Teams\nIf you’re unable to\ncreate a new “team” in Microsoft Teams\n, there’s a good chance you don’t have the right permissions. Microsoft Teams administrators can all create Teams, and they can share this permission with other users. However, by default, guests, external users, and everyday team members won’t be able to create teams themselves.\nIf you do have administrative privileges, there’s a chance you’ve reached the “team limit” for your account. Companies can create up to 250 teams per Microsoft Teams account, although you can be part of up to 1,000 teams. In both cases, it’s a good idea to reach out to your administrators or contact Microsoft’s support team directly.\nProblem: Can’t Establish a Connection to Microsoft Teams\nThis is one of the most common Microsoft Teams issues, and it’s usually the result of either a backend problem with the Teams software or poor internet connectivity. First, check your internet connection. Make sure you’re linked to the internet and can load pages on a web browser.\nIf you do have an internet connection, but Microsoft Teams isn’t loading, then check\nMicrosoft’s Support page\nfor information about outages. If there are no service issues that you can see, you can try some of the other tips I’ve mentioned above, such as:\nUpdating Microsoft Teams.\nRestarting your app or computer.\nUsing the Microsoft web client instead of the desktop app.\nProblem: Microsoft Teams Issues with Logging In\nIf you can access the app or web version of Microsoft Teams but are struggling to log in, there could be a few problems. First, make sure you’re entering the right login information. If you get a notification saying your login details are incorrect, you might need to change your password.\nWhen your login details aren’t the problem, Microsoft might display certain codes to show you why the login process isn’t working. Here’s what each common code means:\n0xCAA20003:\nAuthorization error: Check the date and time on your device is configured correctly, and consider reloading the app.\n0xCAA5004B:\nThe app is experiencing an unexpected issue. Wait a minute and try again, or use the web version of the app.\n0xCAA82EE2:\nThe request timed out. Check your internet connection, and make sure firewalls aren’t blocking access.\n0xCAA20004:\nRequest requires approval: Make sure your organisation is complying with the configuration policies for Azure Active Directory.\n0xCAA82EE7:\nServer not resolved: Check you’re connected to the internet, and firewalls aren’t blocking access.\nProblem: We Weren’t Able to Connect, Try Again\nThis is one of the most frustrating and common Microsoft Teams issues I encounter on a regular basis. When you load your Microsoft Teams app or web client, you might see a message telling you that the app couldn’t connect. It’ll ask you to sign in and try again.\nThis could just be a sign that your organisation is using a “mandatory sign out” option to ensure other people can’t gain access to your account. If that’s the case, you just need to sign into your account again. If this doesn’t work, you might need to quit out of the application completely by right-clicking the icon on your device and selecting “Quit”.\nQuitting out of the app completely will clear the cache and should fix the problem. If it doesn’t, quit out again, and right-click the Start menu icon and select “Run”. Enter the %AppData%/Microsoft code, click “OK”, then right-click the Teams folder and rename it.\nNext, open the Teams app and try to use it again.\nProblem: Teams is Stuck in a Browser Log-in Loop\nMany people experience this issue when using\nMicrosoft Edge\nto access the web version of Microsoft Teams. You might log into Teams, then automatically be redirected back into the log-in page, over, and over. The most common reason for this is that your organisation is using the “Trusted Sites” security option, and hasn’t enabled access for MS Teams.\nTo address this problem, open Microsoft Edge, go to “Settings,” and click “Cookies and site permissions.” Choose “Manage and delete cookies and site data,” then enable the option to allow sites to save and read cookie data. Make sure the option to “block third-party cookies” is off.\nUnder the “Allow” section, make sure you add the following sites:\n[*.]microsoft.com\n[*.]microsoftonline.com\n[*.]teams.microsoft.com\nIf you’re experiencing a similar problem with Google Chrome or an alternative browser, check your browser’s cookies and permissions settings. This problem can also happen when you’re using Microsoft’s Authenticator app for logging in. If you’re using the app correctly, but Teams still doesn’t load, close and re-open your web browser.\nProblem: Microsoft Teams Keeps Freezing or Crashing\nIf your Microsoft Teams app is constantly freezing and crashing, there are a few potential fixes. One of the best ways to address the problem (and many Microsoft Teams issues) is to shut the app down completely, using the steps I’ve mentioned above.\nIf you can’t quit the app by right-clicking on the icon, use your task manager (Ctrl+Alt+Delete on Windows or Command+Option+Esc) on Mac to force quit the application.\nOther quick fixes include making sure you’re running the latest version of Microsoft Teams or running a “troubleshooting” session via Windows. You can do this by taking the Windows+I keys on your keyboard, then clicking on “System”, “Troubleshoot”, and “Other Troubleshooters”. Scroll to “Windows Store apps” and click “Run”.\nStill Having Microsoft Teams Issues?\nIf you’re still having Microsoft Teams issues not related to the problems I’ve mentioned above, you can still solve a range of the most common bugs in the following ways:\nQuit (right-click on the Teams icon), or force quit (use the task manager on your device) the Microsoft Teams application, and restart the app.\nDelete the app cache: A cluttered or corrupted cache can cause a range of issues, from crashes, to slow app operation. You can find out how to clear your cache for Microsoft Teams on any device\nwith this guide\n.\nDelete and reinstall the Microsoft Teams app. This should automatically clear the cache and remove any corrupted files causing operational issues.\nUpdate to the latest version of Microsoft Teams by clicking the (…) button next to your profile and selecting “Check for Updates”.\nQuit other background apps. Some Microsoft Teams problems occur because other apps are using all your RAM. Open your activity monitor to find the apps using the most memory and force-quit them if they’re unnecessary.\nSet the Microsoft Teams app to open at startup. You can do this by clicking on the (…) button on your app, selecting “Settings”, and choosing the “Auto-start Teams” option.\nOvercome Common MS Teams Problems\nMicrosoft Teams issues will always occur from time to time. Sometimes, there’s not much you can do except wait for Microsoft to fix a problem themselves. Other times, however, you might be able to fix the issue yourself with just a few basic steps.\nRemember, if you regularly encounter the same problems or have an issue I haven’t mentioned here, you can always report it to Microsoft. Just click the (…) button next to your profile picture, then “Help”, followed by “Give feedback”.\nDigital Transformation\nHybrid Work\nVideo Conferencing\nBrands mentioned in this

was introduced in 2017\nas a unified communication and collaboration platform aimed at helping businesses and organizations get things done. Microsoft leveraged the company’s existing Office software experience and created a unified experience between Teams, Office 365, and Skype for Business. However, as with all software, things don’t always go according to plan. If you’re\nusing Microsoft Teams\n, sometimes you can run into problems.\nWe’re big Teams users here at Digital Trends — it’s our go-to communication and meeting tool — and we’ve come across a few issues ourselves over the years. In the event you’re having Microsoft Teams issues, here’s how to fix some of the most common problems.\nImage used with permission by copyright holder\nHow to check if Microsoft Teams is down\nLike any software, Microsoft Teams can encounter occasional issues. While these challenges may originate on your end, it’s wise to first investigate any potential difficulties on Microsoft’s part before embarking on extensive troubleshooting.\nRecommended Videos\nBegin by visiting the official\nMicrosoft 365 Status page\nor the associated\nX/Twitter account\ndedicated to this purpose. Keep an eye out for any recent tweets related to Microsoft Teams. Microsoft utilizes this platform to announce technical issues, so if there’s a recent notification, your best course of action may be to exercise patience. Additionally, you can monitor the official\nMicrosoft Teams Twitter account\nor search for the #\nMicrosoftTeams\nhashtag. When you observe multiple users reporting problems with Teams, you can relax and wait for Microsoft to resolve the issue.\nIf Twitter fails to provide the necessary information, you can resort to a service like\nDowndetector\n. In the event of a surge in reported Microsoft Teams issues, take a moment to peruse the comments section, as fellow users may have shared valuable insights. It’s important to note that Microsoft will not report a Teams outage to third-party websites, so you may not receive definitive confirmation here.\nLastly, consult your colleagues to inquire if they’ve encountered any Microsoft Teams issues within the past few hours. It’s possible that your entire organization could be facing the same problem.\nAssuming that Teams works for almost everyone except you, keep reading to get it fixed.\nTeams only shows older messages and threads\nIf you aren’t receiving the latest messages from your colleagues, or your feed appears to be frozen in time, we would recommend restarting the application.\nTo restart Teams on Windows, look for the\nTeams\nicon (a small purple and white icon of two people and a T) in the taskbar in the lower-right of your screen — you may need to click a little arrow to expand the taskbar. Once the icon is located, right-click it and select\nQuit\n. On MacOS, right-click the\nTeams\nicon in your Dock, then choose\nQuit\n. Now, reopen the application to see if your problem has been solved.\nIf you are still having Microsoft Teams issues when it comes to loading the latest messages, check your internet connection to ensure everything else is working fine. You can do this by simply opening your browser and heading to a reliable website you often visit. Check a few different websites to make sure your internet is not disconnected or slow. You can also verify it by running a test on\nSpeedtest.net\n.\nMicrosoft Teams also has a web version that you can try if the app is misbehaving. Sign in at\nhttps://teams.microsoft.com/\nand check if your messages are loading there.\nImage used with permission by copyright holder\nMicrophone or webcam problems\nIf you’re having Microsoft Teams issues with your webcam or microphone, begin by ensuring that your hardware is plugged in correctly. Next, make sure that during a meeting, your microphone and webcam are enabled — you will see toggle switches for these options when you join a new call.\nIf other applications can see your webcam and microphone but Teams cannot, you may need to allow permissions for Teams. To alter permissions on Windows, click the\nWindows search bar\n(located within the left side of the taskbar) then type in “Webcam.” After selecting\nChoose which apps can access your camera\n, make sure the toggle underneath\nLet desktop apps access your camera\nis switched to the\nOn\nposition. Then scroll past the toggle to make sure that Teams and the browser apps you use to access the web version of Teams are included in the list of apps that have been granted this permission.\nTo alter Teams’ permissions on MacOS, click the\nApple\nicon in the upper-left corner of the screen, then choose\nSystem\nPreferences\n. From here, select\nSecurity & privacy\n, then\nCamera\n— you may need to click the\nLock\nicon to make changes here. Ensure that Teams or the web browser you are using to access Teams is enabled on the right.\nIf that didn’t help, make sure you have the latest Windows or MacOS update available as well as the latest version of Teams itself. Updating Teams is easy — select the\nThree dots icon\nto the left of your\nProfile icon\nin the top-right corner of the app and choose\nCheck for updates\n. While you’re at it, check if your internet connection is working fine by visiting a few of your favorite websites.\nYou should also verify whether your camera is not currently being used by another app, such as Skype or WhatsApp. You can do this by closing all the other messenger apps that could possibly take control of your camera.\nIf you’re using Teams in English, you can make a test call to check whether everything is fine on your end — after all, it could be an issue with Teams. At the top-right of Teams, select the\nThree dots icon\n, then choose\nSettings > Devices.\nUnder\nSync device buttons,\nselect\nMake a test call.\nUnable to create a new team in Microsoft Teams\nIf you’re trying to\ncreate a new team in Microsoft Teams\nbut encountering difficulties, it’s advisable to consult your system administrator. Some companies and organizations have the capability to restrict individuals from forming new groups or teams. To address this issue, contact your IT department for additional guidance and support.\nAssuming you are the one in charge of creating new teams for your organization, you may have reached the limit for teams assigned by Microsoft to your company account. There might also be an issue with administrator permissions given to your user account. In both cases, you should reach out to the vendor who manages your organization’s Microsoft Teams access.\nMicrosoft\nUnable to establish a connection to Microsoft Teams\nIf you’re having problems accessing Teams, make sure that your Mac, PC, or mobile device can access other networks or internet content. If your computer is connected to the internet but Teams is still inaccessible, the service might be down. Check with\nMicrosoft’s Support page\nto see if they are having problems with the Teams service.\nMost of the fixes we’ve gone over above are also helpful here. Update your Microsoft Teams app to the latest version by selecting the\nThree dots icon\nto the left of your\nProfile photo\nin the top-right corner of the app. Select\nCheck for updates\nand let the software do its job.\nAssuming the Microsoft Teams app doesn’t work for you, you can always try to access it through the web client on the\nofficial Microsoft website\n.\nMicrosoft\nTeams is stuck in a login loop in Microsoft Edge\nIf you are using Microsoft Edge, or the older Internet Explorer (\nwhich is officially retired, so it’s time for a change!\n), you may find that your login screen for Teams is stuck in a loop. This is likely because your organization uses the Trusted Sites option and hasn’t enabled Microsoft Teams.\nYou can follow these steps to allow Teams. If you are blocked from the process, you may need to contact your system administrator or IT help desk for further assistance.\nStep 1:\nOpen Microsoft Edge.\nStep 2:\nGo to\nSettings\n, then select\nCookies and\ns\nite\npermissions\n.\nStep 3:\nNext, select\nManage and delete\ncookies and site data\n.\nStep 4:\nEnable\nAllow sites to save and read cookie data (recommended)\n.\nStep 5:\nThen ensure that\nBlock third-party cookies\nis off. If you need to keep this setting on instead for some reason, go to step 6.\nStep 6:\nUnder the\nAllow\nsection, add the following sites:\n[*.]microsoft.com\n[*.]microsoftonline.com\n[*.]teams.skype.com\n[*.]teams.microsoft.com\n[*.]sfbassets.com\n[*.]skypeforbusiness.com\nCan’t access a Microsoft Teams OneNote notebook\nIf your document libraries contain more than 5,000 OneNote items, Teams may deliver this message: “One or more of the document libraries on the user or group’s OneDrive contains more than 5,000 OneNote items (notebooks, sections, section groups) and cannot be queried using the API. Please make sure that none of the user or group’s document libraries contains more than 5,000 OneNote items. Please follow the link below for instructions on how to remedy this situation.”\nTo correct this error, you will need to reduce the number of items in OneNote below 5,000.\nMicrosoft provides this OneNote API Diagnostic\ntool for counting the number of items in a specific document library, which may assist you at this time.\nImage used with permission by copyright holder\nTeams won’t allow you to log in to the service\nIf you are having Microsoft Teams issues logging in to the service, begin by ensuring that you are entering the correct login information. You may receive one of the error codes listed below if you are entering the accurate information but are still being denied access. Contact your IT department with the given error code, as the issue will need to be removed by your system administrator.\nCommon Microsoft Teams login error codes:\n0xCAA20003:\nAuthorization problem — make sure the date and time are configured correctly.\n0xCAA82EE2:\nRequest timed out — confirm you’re connected to the internet and firewalls aren’t blocking access to the service.\n0xCAA82EE7:\nServer not resolved — confirm you are connected to the internet and firewalls aren’t stopping access to the service.\n0xCAA20004:\nRequest requires approval — make sure that the organization is complying with Azure Active Directory configuration policies.\n0xCAA90018:\nIncorrect credentials — you are using the wrong credentials to sign in to Microsoft 365 services.\n0xCAA5004B:\nThe Microsoft Teams app has encountered an unexpected issue — wait a few minutes and try again or\nuse the web version\n. (Our comparison of\nMicrosoft Teams’ online web app vs the desktop app\nhighlights the differences.)\nNotifications are not being delivered to your desktop\nIf you’re not receiving notifications from Microsoft Teams anymore, it may not be a glitch — the permissions just might’ve changed. Begin by checking that the Teams app has the correct settings enabled.\nOpen the Microsoft Teams app, select the\nThree-dots\nicon next to your\nProfile photo\nin the top right, and choose\nSettings\n. Next, select the\nNotifications\noption. Make sure that your notifications are still on and that the permissions are what they should be. If they aren’t, adjust these settings as necessary.\nSkype\nUnable to send a message in Skype for Business\nWhen attempting to send a message to an individual Skype for Business account, encountering an operation failure may be attributed to two common causes. First, it’s essential to verify that the recipient’s status is configured as “Available” or another active state. If both users are indeed available, the second consideration is to ensure that both parties are using Microsoft Teams as the platform for message exchange. The promising aspect is that Microsoft is already cognizant of this issue. However, the less favorable news is that a solution is still in the works.\nError message: ‘We weren’t able to connect. Sign in and we’ll try again.’\nOne of the most frustrating Microsoft Teams issues that you might run into with the app is the message, “We weren’t able to connect. Sign in and we’ll try again.” This notification appears when you leave the Teams app idle for too long. If you don’t notice when this banner notification pops up, you could miss out on any announcements and meeting prompts until you address it.\nSadly, restarting the app isn’t enough to fix the problem, but you can typically solve it by resetting the app’s cache. To do this, simply follow the below steps:\nStep 1:\nCompletely quit the Teams application by right-clicking the\nTeams\nicon in the system tray (next to the clock on your taskbar) and selecting\nQuit\n.\nStep 2:\nRight-click the\nStart menu\nicon and click\nRun\n.\nStep 3:\nIn the Run window that appears, type\n%AppData%/Microsoft\n. Click\nOK\n.\nStep 4:\nIn the new window, right-click the\nTeams\nfolder and select\nRename.\nStep 5:\nType in\nTeamsBackup\n, (or any other name you may want) then hit\nEnter\non your keyboard.\nOpen the Teams app and try to use it once more. You’ll likely have to reconfigure your settings from the beginning, but you should finally have this issue resolved.\nMicrosoft Teams keeps on freezing or shutting down\nOne of the most common Microsoft Teams issues is that the app will sometimes randomly freeze or shut down. Luckily, there are a few steps you can take to fix this nuisance.\nRestart the app by shutting it down fully. On Windows, you can do this by accessing the\nTask manager\nthrough the following combination of keys:\nCtrl + Alt + Del\n. Navigate to\nTask manager >\nMicrosoft Teams >\nEnd task\n. On MacOS, use this key combination instead:\nCommand + Option + Esc\n. This will force quit the app. A Force Quit window should appear; choose\nMicrosoft Teams\n, then select the\nForce Quit\nbutton.\nMake sure you’re running the latest version of Microsoft Teams before you delve into this any further. Simply select the\nThree dots icon\nto the left of your\nProfile photo\nwhen the app is currently working. You’ll find it in the top-right corner of Teams. Next, select\nCheck for updates\nand download the newest version.\nYou can also troubleshoot or repair the app via Windows itself, but this depends on your level of access when it comes to administration rights. Start by trying to access the\nSettings\nby tapping the\nWindows\n+\nI\nkeys simultaneously on your keyboard. Navigate to\nSystem > Troubleshoot > Other trouble-shooters.\nScroll down until you see\nWindows Store apps\nand then click\nRun\n.\nAlternatively, from\nWindows settings\n, click on\nApps\nand then\nApps & features\n. Once you find Microsoft Teams, click on\nAdvanced options\nand repair the app. This should not affect your data.\nImage used with permission by copyright holder\nOne last possible fix: it might be worth\nuninstalling and then reinstalling Microsoft Teams\n.\nError message: ‘You’re missing out!’\nHave you received an odd error message when trying to sign in to Teams? This problem affects users who run Microsoft 365 Education. Upon trying to sign in, you may encounter an error that says: “You’re missing out! Ask your admin to enable Microsoft Teams for <CompanyName>.”\nMicrosoft itself is aware of this problem and notes that in Microsoft 365 Education, Teams is not “enabled by default.” This means that your school’s system administrator will have to enable it manually.\n‘Are you still there?’ message appears\nIf you’re using the web version of Teams, you may have been dealing with this fairly annoying problem — frequent pop-ups that ask if you’re still there and active. Microsoft allegedly added this functionality to reduce unnecessary sync time. After all, if you’re not actively using the app, there is no need to refresh your other tabs for you. Unfortunately, this can still pop up in the middle of a meeting and log you out for no reason.\nThe easiest way to avoid this would be to use the proper Microsoft Teams software as opposed to the web version. Alternatively, try to minimize the amount of Teams tabs you’re running at any given time, and if you can’t, then try to mix up the web version and the app. Use the latter for meetings and other important things that you can’t afford to be logged out of.\nTeams audio not working with Android Auto\nAndroid Auto has a feature that allows you to tap into a web conference so you can watch and listen to it while you are driving, a great time saver when commuting. But Microsoft Teams users have encountered a bug that prevents the audio from working, so all they get is silence.\nGoogle investigated this issue in 2022 and reported that any remaining issue is entirely on Microsoft’s side. Microsoft has yet to announce any patches addressing it specifically.\nIf you’re having this issue, update to the latest version of Android Auto. Some users have said that this fixed the problem for them. Otherwise, switch to audio from your phone, or audio via your car’s Bluetooth connection instead.\nTeams opens on startup\nIf your boss expects you to respond to any message, Teams starting right away whenever you turn on your computer could be a big, annoying issue. Here’s how to stop Teams from opening on startup:\nStep 1:\nPress\nCtrl\n+\nShift\n+\nEsc\nto open up your Task Manager.\nStep 2:\nTap the ‘Startup’ tap at the top.\nStep 3:\nRight click the Microsoft Teams app and select ‘Disable’.\nAfter making this switch, don’t forget to turn on your Teams when you start work or your boss might consider you absent.\nNone of the above solutions fixed your problem?\nMicrosoft Teams issues can certainly get annoying, and if nothing helps, it’s time to escalate. While Microsoft Teams has its fair share of bugs that you’ll regularly experience, having more consistent problems might be something you need to get your company’s IT administrator to solve.\nIf you happen to be the administrator for your company, you can read through\nMicrosoft’s support documentation\n, which is made readily available to anyone in need of assistance. If none of the troubleshooting options from the doc work for you, you’ll have to contact Microsoft’s technical team for hands-on help with your specific issue.\nDo you use Zoom too? If you ever run into any\nZoom problems, there are ways to fix them too\n.\nMichael Archambault\nFormer Digital Trends Contributor\ntwitter\nMichael Archambault is a technology writer and digital marketer located in Long Island, New York.

Well, I can give a pretty haphazard answer to that. But if I were to give a broad verdict, I would say any PC that gets the job done without nuking your wallet, heating like a pan, and lasting at least a full day without forcing you to hunt for a wall socket, takes the cake.\nApple has mastered that art with the MacBook Air, and to such an extent that shoppers have no qualms spending on two, or even three-generation-old, machines.

This feature isn't available for Microsoft 365 Government, Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet, or Microsoft 365 Germany.\nSelect the following button to populate the diagnostic in the Microsoft 365 admin center:\nRun Tests: Teams Sign-in\nIn the\nProvide the username or email of the user reporting this issue\nfield, enter the email address of the affected user, and then select\nRun Tests\n.\nRun the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer diagnostic\nNote\nCurrently the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool doesn't support Microsoft 365 Government environments (GCC or GCC High).\nOpen a web browser, and then go to the\nTeams Sign in\ntest.\nSign in by using the credentials of the user account that you want to test.\nEnter the provided verification code.\nSelect\nVerify\n.\nThis test verifies that the user account meets the requirements to sign in to Teams.\nFix the issue manually\nIf you want to perform the checks and fix the issue manually, follow these steps:\nIf the diagnostic detects an issue that affects the instance of Teams on the tenant, follow the provided solution to fix the issue. If the diagnostic doesn't detect an issue, check whether the user's\nTeams client is running the latest update\n. Select the\nSettings and more\nmenu next to the user's profile picture at the top right of the Teams window, and then select\nCheck for updates\n.\nThe desktop app is configured to update automatically. However, if you find that the app is missing the latest update, follow the instructions to install it, and try again to sign in. If you still see an error when you try to sign in to Teams, go to step 3.\nCheck the error code on the Teams sign-in screen. If the code is listed here, follow the provided guidance to fix the error. If the code isn't listed here, see\nWhy am I having trouble signing in to Microsoft Teams?\n0xCAA82EE7\nor\n0xCAA82EE2\nMake sure that the user has Internet access. Then, use the\nNetwork assessment tool\nto verify that the network and network elements between the user location and the Microsoft network are configured correctly. This is necessary to enable communication to the IP addresses and ports that are required for Teams calls.\nFor information about endpoints that users should be able to reach if they're using Teams in Microsoft 365 plans, government environments, or other clouds, see\nMicrosoft 365 URLs and IP address ranges\n.\n0xCAA20004\nThis error occurs if an issue affects conditional access. For more information, see\nConditional Access policies for Teams\n.\n0xCAA70004\nor\n0xCAA70007\n, or if the sign-in issue also occurs in other Office applications: See\nConnection issues in sign-in after update to Office 2016 build 16.0.7967\n.\nIf the sign-in error occurs only in the Teams web client, see\nMicrosoft Teams is stuck in a login loop\nfor resolutions that are specific to the user's preferred browser.\nIf the error persists, reinstall Teams as follows:\nUninstall Teams\n.\nBrowse to the\n%appdata%\\Microsoft\nfolder on the user's computer, and delete the\nTeams\nfolder.\nDownload and install\nTeams\n. If possible, reinstall Teams as an administrator. To do this, right-click the Teams installer file, and select\nRun as administrator\n.\nIf none of these steps helps to resolve the Teams sign-in issue, create a support request.

Microsoft Teams Network Issues\nHow to Troubleshoot & Fix Common Microsoft Teams Issues\nQuick Fixes for Frequent Microsoft Teams Problems\nContinuous Monitoring of Microsoft Teams\nMicrosoft Teams is one of the most popular tools for work communication today. Whether you're chatting with your team, jumping on a video call, or sharing files, it helps keep everyone connected. But let's face it – MS Teams isn’t perfect. You’ve probably run into issues like calls dropping, bad audio, or slow Teams performance. These problems can be frustrating, especially when you’re in the middle of an important meeting or deadline.\nHere’s the good news: most Microsoft Teams issues have simple explanations and fixes. The key is figuring out where the problem is coming from – your device, your network, or Microsoft itself. Once you know the cause, it’s much easier to troubleshoot and get back to work.\nIn this article, we’ll cover the most common Microsoft Teams issues, how to find out what’s causing them, and easy steps to fix them. Let’s make sure Teams works as smoothly for you as it should!\nIs It a User, Network, or Microsoft Teams Issue?\nWhen Microsoft Teams isn’t working as it should, the first step to fixing it is figuring out what’s causing the problem.\nIn this article, we’ll cover some of the most common Microsoft Teams issues:\nMicrosoft Teams connection issues (Internet connectivity, network congestion, VPN interface)\nAudio and video issues\nLogin and authentication problems\nNetwork issues (poor Internet connection, high latency, packet loss, VPN interference)\nMany people are quick to blame Microsoft when issues occur, but the reality is that less than 1% of MS Teams issues are actually caused by Microsoft themselves. Instead, most problems can be traced back to one of three main sources: user, network, or MS Teams itself.\n24% of Teams issues stem from the user side\n75% of Teams issues are network-related\nLess than 1% of issues come directly from Microsoft\nUnderstanding where the problem lies is key to troubleshooting effectively and ensuring a smooth Microsoft Teams experience.\n1. User-Specific Microsoft Teams Problems\nThese issues are related to the device or actions of the person using Teams. For example, it could be a microphone that isn’t connected, outdated software, or incorrect app permissions. If the problem only happens to one person or on one device, it’s likely a user-specific issue.\nFor instance, if users are complaining about poor Internet connection at the office affecting their Teams calls, it could just be a user issue. It’s important to rule out device-specific problems before assuming it’s the network or Microsoft Teams itself.\n2. Network-Related Microsoft Teams Issues\nSince Teams relies heavily on the Internet, a slow or unstable connection can cause problems like dropped calls, lag, or poor video quality. If multiple users on the same network are experiencing issues, your network is likely the culprit.\n3. Microsoft Teams Server Problems\nMost of the time, when users experience issues with Microsoft Teams, the root cause isn’t actually with Teams itself\n– it’s usually related to the user’s device or network. However, there are occasions when the problem is on Microsoft’s side. Microsoft Teams may experience outages or performance issues on their servers. When this happens, it affects many users at the same time, and the only fix is to wait for Microsoft to resolve it.\nCommon Indicators for Each Type of Microsoft Teams Issue\nOnce you’ve identified that an issue exists, it’s important to look for clues that point to the source of the problem.\nFor the beginners, start by asking these questions:\nDoes the issue happen on one device or multiple?\nAre other apps working fine, or is it just Teams?\nIs anyone else on your network experiencing the same issue?\nHave you checked Microsoft’s Service Status page for updates?\nHere are the common signs for each type of Microsoft Teams issue:\n1. User-Specific Problems\nOnly One Person Affected:\nIf the issue is limited to one user while others on the same network have no problems, it’s likely user-specific.\nDevice or App Errors:\nMessages like “Camera not found” or “Your microphone isn’t working” usually mean there’s a problem with the user’s device, app permissions, or settings.\nFrequent Crashes:\nThe app crashes on one device but works on others, which points to local issues like outdated software or corrupted installations.\n2. Network-Related Issues\nLag, Dropped Calls, or Poor Quality:\nIssues like frozen video or choppy audio often indicate network problems, such as\nlow bandwidth\nor high latency.\nMultiple Users Affected:\nIf everyone on the same network experiences similar issues, it’s likely a network-related problem.\nError Messages About Connectivity:\nMessages like “We couldn’t connect you. Check your Internet connection and try again” are clear indicators of Internet or network interference.\n3. Microsoft Teams Server Problems\nWidespread Issues Across Locations:\nIf users in different locations report similar problems, it might be an issue on Microsoft’s end.\nService Status Messages:\nCheck the Microsoft 365 Service Status page or social media updates for information about ongoing\nnetwork outages\n.\nUnusual Error Codes:\nErrors like \"Caa20001\" or \"Caa50021\" often point to server-side problems that you can’t resolve locally.\nHow to Identify MS Teams Issues\nWhen people complain about poor Microsoft Teams call quality and claim it’s better at home, is it really a Teams issue, or are they just avoiding the office? (Could it be a user problem?) Microsoft Teams is widely used, but it’s also one of the most resource-intensive and quality-sensitive apps out there, meaning that issues can arise for many reasons.\nTroubleshooting Teams problems can be a headache due to the variety of factors involved, from the user's device to the network and even Teams itself. That’s why it's essential to monitor\nMicrosoft Teams performance metrics\nfrom all angles – so you can quickly identify the root cause and avoid wasting time on endless troubleshooting.\nWhen someone reports a Microsoft Teams issue, don’t guess, use Obkio’s Network and Microsoft Teams Monitoring Tool. With Obkio, you can monitor end-to-end Teams performance across the user, the network, and Teams itself in just seconds. This helps you quickly determine whether there’s a real problem and where it lies.\nObkio’s continuous synthetic testing establishes performance baselines and helps replicate user problems, making it the first step in effective troubleshooting. By replicating the issue, you can pinpoint whether the problem is with the user, the network, or Teams, and collect the data needed to resolve it efficiently.\nHere’s how to get started:\nMicrosoft Teams Monitoring to Troubleshoot & Optimize Performance\nElevate Teams performance with Microsoft Teams monitoring. Discover how to optimize Microsoft Teams performance & identify Teams performance issues.\nLearn more\nStep 1: Monitor Microsoft Teams Performance\nTo identify Microsoft Teams issues, the first step is to continuously monitor your network and Microsoft Teams performance. Using\nObkio’s Microsoft Teams Monitoring Tool\nensures you get real-time insights into key performance metrics such as latency, jitter, packet loss, and congestion — all of which directly affect Teams' audio and video quality.\nWith Obkio, you can specifically monitor performance between Microsoft Teams, your network (and Internet), and the end-users.

These tests are conducted both between Microsoft Teams and other Agents, ensuring comprehensive monitoring.\nWith end-to-end visibility, Obkio covers up to 99% of the call path during Teams calls, allowing you to proactively detect user-related, network-related, or Teams issues before they impact real users. This ensures you're able to resolve problems early, minimizing disruptions and maintaining a seamless Teams experience.\n14-day free trial of all premium features\nDeploy in just 10 minutes\nMonitor performance in all key network locations\nMeasure real-time network metrics\nIdentify and troubleshoot live network problems\nHow Obkio's Microsoft Teams Monitoring Actually Works\nThanks to Obkio's synthetic testing approach, you don't need an active Teams call to monitor performance. You'll always have visibility into potential Teams issues, even before they happen. Here's how it works:\nCreating a Teams Meeting*\n: The Obkio platform initiates a Microsoft Teams meeting to begin the monitoring process\nJoining with Monitoring Agents\n: Obkio Agents, equipped with Obkio's Office 365 licenses, join the Teams meeting\nInjecting Audio/Video Traffic\n: For 35 seconds, the Agents inject audio and video traffic into the meeting, simulating real-life communication\nAnalyzing Performance\n: The Agents exit the meeting, and Obkio requests performance metrics from Microsoft's API\nContinuous Monitoring: This cycle repeats every minute to continuously assess Microsoft Teams performance\nThree-Perspective MS Teams Monitoring for Complete Visibility\nObkio monitors performance between Microsoft Teams, your network (and Internet), and the end-users from three key perspectives:\nUser Perspective\n: Monitors the user's environment including network card performance, CPU usage, and disk usage to ensure adequate resources for Teams\nNetwork Perspective\n: Tracks network performance metrics using Obkio's core NPM features, identifying issues like latency, jitter, packet loss, and QoS misconfigurations\nMicrosoft's API\n: Connects to Microsoft's API to download detailed call quality reports that complement the network testing\nStep 2: Deploy Network & Microsoft Teams Monitoring Agents\nTo monitor Teams effectively, you’ll need to deploy\nObkio Monitoring Agents\nat key network locations where Teams is used. These agents continuously exchange synthetic traffic to measure network performance between your users, your network and Microsoft Teams.\nRecommended Agent Setup:\nAzure Monitoring Agent:\nMicrosoft Teams runs on Microsoft Azure. Deploy\nMicrosoft Azure Agent\nin the closest Azure data center to monitor Teams' server-side performance.\nPublic Monitoring Agent:\nUse an\nAWS\nor\nGoogle Cloud\nagent to compare performance up to the Internet. This helps determine whether the issue is global or specific to Teams.\nLocal Monitoring Agent:\nInstall an agent in the affected office or remote location to monitor local network performance.\nAgents\nare available for MacOS, Windows, Linux, and more.\nThis setup can also be extended to\nmonitor Microsoft Azure\n,\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365\n, or broader\nMicrosoft network performance\n.\nStep 3: Collect and Analyze Microsoft Teams Performance Data\nOnce your agents are deployed, they start monitoring Microsoft Teams call quality by exchanging synthetic audio and video data. This is done through a Network Monitoring Session, which gathers crucial data on performance metrics from three key perspectives: the user, the network, and Microsoft’s API.\nObkio Monitoring Agents join Microsoft Teams meetings and exchange audio and video data using synthetic traffic. Unlike standard Microsoft tests that analyze call quality using SIP RTC without sending\nnetwork packets\n, Obkio enhances visibility by connecting to Microsoft’s API to download detailed call quality reports. This combined approach gives you comprehensive insight into Teams call performance.\nObkio then runs Network Performance Monitoring (NPM) tests from the Agent’s point of view, assessing the connection between Microsoft Teams, your network, and other Agents. You’ll receive data on key\nmetrics\nsuch as:\nNetwork Latency, Jitter, and Packet Loss\n: These metrics measure delays and data loss, affecting call quality and causing issues like call delays or distorted audio.\nVoIP Quality & MOS (Mean Opinion Score)\n: The\nMOS score\nindicates the overall quality of your Teams calls based on factors like latency, packet loss, and jitter.\nAudio Quality, Latency, and Jitter\n: These metrics determine if audio during a call is clear or affected by delays or synchronization problems.\nVideo Quality, Latency, and Jitter\n: These metrics measure how video performance is impacted by network conditions, ensuring smooth video calls.\nAverage Call Quality Score\n: This score gives an overall indication of the call quality, summarizing performance across multiple factors.\nBy analyzing this data, you can quickly identify whether the issue lies with your network, Microsoft’s servers, or something else, helping you resolve problems faster.\nMicrosoft Teams Network Assessment\nA Microsoft Teams network assessment can also help guide you through this process, offering a deeper understanding of your network's health and its impact on Teams performance. For step-by-step instructions on how to conduct\nMS Teams network assessment\n, check out our Free PDF guide. It’s the perfect resource to get you started on optimizing your Teams experience.\nMost Common Issues with Microsoft Teams\nMicrosoft Teams is a powerful tool, but like any software, it’s not immune to issues. Here are some of the most common Microsoft Teams issues that users face like Microsoft Teams connection issues (Internet connectivity, network congestion, VPN interface), audio and video issues, login and authentication problems, and network issues (poor Internet connection, high\nInternet latency\n, packet loss, VPN interference)\nWe'll also discuss their potential causes, and the error messages they may encounter.

Regular updates mean you have access to the latest features, security enhancements, and bug fixes. Updating not only improves the overall performance and reliability of the application, it also helps you and your team collaborate more efficiently. By staying current with updates, you reduce the risk of having issues and ensure compatibility with other tools, making it easier to focus on your work without interruptions.\nServicing agreement\nAs part of a modern online service, the Teams client is updated twice a month. The client automatically installs updates when they become available to that client. Because we stagger the availability of updates worldwide using\nsafe deployment practices\n, some clients in your organization might receive new updates before others. Because the\nModern Lifecycle Policy\ngoverns Teams, users should remain on the most up-to-date version of the desktop client. Auto-updates ensure that users have the latest capabilities, performance enhancements, security, and service reliability.\nTo identify when desktop clients fall out of date, an in-app alert displays if the user's current version is between one and three months old and if new version's available. This in-app messaging encourages users to update to the latest version of Teams or, if necessary, to reach out to their IT admin to do so. Users on Teams desktop clients that are more than three months old see a blocking page. This page gives the options to update now, reach out to their IT admin, or continue to Teams on the web.\nFor information on new version releases, check\nMessage Center\nor go to\nHelp\n>\nWhat's new\nin the client.\nTeams client updates timeline\nNew updates for the Teams desktop client are released twice a month after thorough internal testing and validation through our Technology Adoption Program (TAP). The desktop client is rolled out to customers gradually.\nImportant\nWhen there's a critical update, Teams bypasses the regular schedule and releases the update immediately.\nOther factors that help your client to stay up-to-date:\nOperating System (OS):\nMeets the minimum OS requirements for Teams.\nYour OS version is up-to-date (non-LTSC update channel) and still under support.\nYour OS has the latest patches installed.\nWebview2:\nWebview2 updates automatically on Windows, you should make sure it isn't blocked. Teams updates Webview2 on macOS.\nWebview2 must be a supported version (latest version).\nFor more information, see\nTeams client system requirements\n.\nUpdating Teams on Windows devices\nUpdate checks\n: Teams applications on both Windows and Mac devices check for updates when the application starts up and every few hours in the background, whether the application is running or not. A user must be signed into the machine for updates to happen.\nDownload\n: Updates are downloaded based on availability and staged to the user session. By using Windows Delivery Optimization, only the delta that's different from the current installed version (the differential update) is downloaded.\nRestart\n: Restarting the application is required for the update to take effect.\nManual\n: The update starts automatically when the application is idle on Windows clients. Selecting the\nRestart\nbutton next to the ellipsis (...) button in the client allows a user to restart sooner.\nIssues with Teams client updates in Windows and best practices\nWindows delivery optimization service is disabled or configured with unsupported mode (100). This configuration blocks the updater's ability to download the update payload.\nThere's a Windows Delivery Optimization service configuration requirement:\nTeams client system requirements\n.\nEnabling the Peer to Peer capability isn't required.\nA user modifies Team's app package. The MSIX packages are installed machine-wide under the Program Files directory. The Windows OS tightly controls and monitors the file ACLs. If a user modifies or changes the file ACLs, the system deems the application to be in a corrupted state. This circumstance leads to unexpected behaviors such as crashing, unexpected app termination, and a failure to update.\nIt's essential to make sure the files under the installation directory (%programfiles%\\windowsapps) aren't altered in any way.\nNetwork settings that block Team's CDN endpoints cause delivery optimization service failures and a failure to update the app.\nYou must allow Microsoft M365 endpoints in network configuration. For more information, see\nMicrosoft 365 URLs and IP address ranges\n.\nAvoid SSL inspection on M365 endpoints. SSL inspection is known to cause high update download failure rate and retries.\nA device is running an out of support OS, or a Windows version that doesn't have the latest updates and patches can lower the success of Teams updates.\nWindows 11 improves the Teams application update success rate and reliability as it has the most current installer.\nMake sure you install all OS patches before deploying Teams on Windows 10 or Windows 11.\nUpdating Teams on Mac devices\nThe Teams desktop client updates itself using Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU), similar to other Microsoft applications. Learn more about MAU at\nConfiguring Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) for Organization Specific Updates\n.\nTeams uses default MAU Office channels for updates and a custom channel for Teams-specific scenarios. The post-installation script registers the app with MAU's default Office channel (Current, Preview, or Beta) to ensure Mau updates the app without running itself.\nWhen the update is downloaded while Teams is running, we use MAU's\nInstall On Clone\nfeature, to prepare the installation. Once a user quits the application, MAU moves the clone to the /Applications folder to finish updates. Teams for Mac doesn't automatically restart to apply updates. It always waits for user to take the action.\nUsers can also select\nCheck for updates\nfrom the Help menu bar item to manually check for updates. This action opens Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU).\nHow to configure MAU\nNo special configuration is required if the MAU preferences are left at default values.\nIf your organization employs managed MAU preferences, the Teams app preferences should look like this example:\n<key>/Applications/Microsoft Teams.app</key>\n    <dict>\n      <key>Application ID</key>\n      <string>TEAMS21</string>\n    </dict>\nNote\nYour configuration may contain an LCID key with a value set to 1033. This value isn't used any longer, and you can delete it.\nIssues with Mac update and best practices\nMicrosoft AutoUpdate (MAU) not being installed or being blocked on your device.\nMAU is an integral part of Teams and included with the Teams installer. When Teams is first installed, MAU is also installed unless it's already present on the device. However, there are instances where firewalls deliberately remove or block MAU.\nTo see if you have MAU installed, select\nCheck for Updates\nfrom the Help menu bar item. This selection should open the MAU user interface, but if MAU isn't installed, nothing happens.\nTo make sure that MAU is allowed to function correctly, we need to first\ncheck the MAU configuration\n. If the configuration is correct and\nMAU is installed\n, and it still doesn't work, it's likely being blocked. In that case, the user should contact their administrator.\nMAU is outdated.\nMicrosoft Teams needs MAU version 4.52.22101101 at a minimum, but we recommend you use version 4.73.24071426 or higher for crucial security updates. MAU self-updates, and a manual update shouldn't be required under the default settings.\nYour organization uses a custom MAU profile and the Teams portion isn't configured correctly.\nAs previously mentioned, Teams handles MAU registration autonomously within user preferences. There are instances when an organization deploys custom MAU preferences using an MDM management system. In such cases, the managed preferences take precedence. Occasionally, these settings might be incorrectly configured. Common issues include a complete lack of Teams configuration or configurations that reference the old name\nMicrosoft Teams (work or school).app\n.\nHow to troubleshoot a MAU configuration\nTo troubleshoot MAU configuration issues, you first need to open the Terminal app and execute the following commands:\ndefaults read /Library/Managed\\ Preferences/com.microsoft.autoupdate2\ndefaults read com.microsoft.autoupdate2\nIn the output, locate the \"/Applications/Microsoft Teams.app\". It should look like:\nBasic:\nApplications= {\n      ...\n      \"/Applications/Microsoft Teams.app\" =     {\n        \"Application ID\" = TEAMS21;\n    };\n    ...\n    }\nCustom channel:\nApplications= {\n      ...\n      \"/Applications/Microsoft Teams.app\" =         {\n      \"Application ID\" = TEAMS21;\n      ChannelName = Custom;\n      ManifestServer = \"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/production-osx/24199.1700.3003.1785/\";\n      ManifestServerExpiryTime = \"2024-08-02T08:40:06Z\";\n    };\n    ...\n    }\nNote\nPreferences in /Library/Managed\\ Preferences/ take precedence. If you see an \"Applications\" entry there, focus solely on that output.\nIf the \"/Application/Microsoft Teams.app\" path is absent, it indicates that the Teams registration is missing, and you need to reach out to your administrator to add the basic registration to the managed preferences profile.\nIf the \"/Application/Microsoft Teams.app\" entry appears but is different from the examples, contact your administrator to resolve the managed preferences profile.\nCommon misconfigurations\nIssue\nExample\nTeams configuration with old name\n\"/Applications/Microsoft Teams\n(work or school).app\n\"\n=     {\n\"Application ID\" =\nTEAMS21\n;\n}\nServing multiple configurations of the same path but with different app IDs\n\"/Applications/\nMicrosoft Teams.app\n\" =     {\n\"Application ID\" =\nTEAMS10\n;\n}\n\"/Applications/\nMicrosoft Teams.app\n\" =     {\n\"Application ID\" =\nTEAMS21\n;\n}\nUpdate issues caused by name mismatch\nA special case might occur when the registration is correct, but your application is still called Microsoft Teams (work or school).app. This issue mostly impacts early adopters and dogfooders. In this situation, you have two options:\nManually download and install the\nlatest version of Teams\n. If you don't have permission to install software, contact an administrator to perform the installation. After the installation is done, you continue to receive updates automatically.\nAdd an additional registration for MAU preferences. Use the following registration to address the name mismatch:\n/Applications/Microsoft Teams.app = {\n    \"Application ID\" = TEAMS21;\n}\n/Applications/Microsoft Teams (work or school).app = {\n    \"Application ID\" = TEAMS21;\n}\n/Applications/Microsoft Teams (work preview).app = {\n    \"Application ID\" = TEAMS21;\n}\nUpdates to Teams on VDI\nSee\nInstall Teams on VDI\n.\nFeedback\nWas this

Microsoft Teams update is causing several issues including call failures, missing notifications, and unknown users. The post mentions trying various fixes, but none have worked so far.","raw_content":"Reddit - The heart of the internet\nSkip to main content\nGo to MicrosoftTeams\nr/MicrosoftTeams\n•\nKiloJouleskJ\nThe New Teams creates so many issues\nThe New Teams is causing multiple problems for clients, and they dont seem to be resolving \"over a few days\" as other posts have suggested. Here is a full list of issues that are on the New Teams but whilst on the Old Teams cease to exist:\nCant pick up some Teams calls\nDoesnt show inbound Teams calls\nWont let people call out\nMissing notifications\nEveryone appearing as unknown user\nWont let people join meetings\nKeeps defaulting to an alternative account\nAnd before the general response, we have done our own fixes that still havent worked. We have cleared Teams cache, updated Teams and Windows, reinstalled Teams, checked all Teams permissions on Windows and the Teams \"app\". The microphone and camera are functioning correctly, notifications work on the Old Teams - not the new one, the Users that appear as unknown were NOT recently added to Azure, it is all of the users who appear as unknown. Windows focus Assist is not diablsing Notifications nor is any other application.\nThis is a serious issue that needs to be resolved, as this new \"app\" does not function for the many users, and why fix something that isnt broken. The new web loader is slow, ineffective, removes Contacts and is overall a worse experience.\nRead more\nShare\nTop Posts\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of June 28, 2024\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of June 2024\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2024\nReddit Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nUser Agreement\nYour Privacy Choices\nAccessibility\nReddit, Inc. © 2026.

I understand how important it is to access your team member folders. I completely understand how important it is to have quick and reliable access to your team member folders, especially when you’re trying to collaborate efficiently. Missing folders can disrupt workflows\nHere are a few steps you can try:\n1/ Check storage quota\nTeams files are stored in SharePoint, which has a per-site storage limit. If your site exceeds that limit, new files and folders won’t appear.\nVisit your SharePoint site’s\nChoose gear icon > Site information > Scroll down and choose View all site settings\nUnder Site Collection Administration > Select Storage Metrics to check usage.\nIf storage is near capacity, delete or offload older files to free up space.\nOnce under the storage threshold, the missing folders should reappear in Teams.\n2/ Ensure files are in the correct channel folder\nEvery Teams channel corresponds to a SharePoint folder. If files are saved in the default Documents folder instead of the channel folder, they won't show under Files in that channel.\nOpen the SharePoint site connected to your Team.\nNavigate to Documents, locate misplaced files, select More (three dot) > Move to > choose the appropriate channel’s folder.\nThis ensures alignment between SharePoint and Teams channel folders.\nYou may find further guidance here:\nFix Microsoft Teams files not appearing (Windows Dispatch)\nNote: Microsoft is providing this information as a convenience to you.

When an account is disabled, it is automatically removed from all teams. After re-enabling, it can take 24 to 48 hours for your account memberships to be restored, but this does not apply to private channels, for which you need to request membership again.\nIf the issue
