If the PDF document is opening as a Word document, it is possible that the file extension has been changed or there's no application for PDF reading on your device.\nFor me to have a better view of your concern, I'd like to ask few questions:\nDoes this issue occur to all of the PDF files on your device?\nWere you able to open PDF files before and if yes, which application you used to open it?\nHere are troubleshooting steps you can follow:\nConfirm first if the files you are trying to open is really a PDF file:\nOpen File Explorer and locate the PDF file.\nRight click it and select\nProperties\n.\nYou will see a\n.pdf\nas an extension beside the\nType of file\n.\nChange the assigned application that launches the PDF file.\nOpen File Explorer and locate the PDF file.\nRight click it and select\nProperties\n.\nYou will see a\n\"Opens with\",\nclick on the\nChange\nbutton.\nOn there select application you want to use in opening the PDF file.\nIf this does not work, please let me know. Providing the additional information asked will help us provide the right resolution for your concern.\nRegards,\nArquel C.\nMicrosoft Moderator\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nStefan Blom\n•\n332.6K\nReputation points\n•\nMVP\n•\nVolunteer Moderator\n2024-02-11T09:49:20+00:00\nInstall a native PDF reader, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader.

Say goodbye to PDF headaches!\nLink copied!\nMany factors can be responsible for preventing the smooth running of Adobe Acrobat. Failure to put things in order can disrupt your workflow, leading to frustration. In this informative write-up, we will enlighten you on the various issues that can prevent your Adobe Acrobat from running. Afterwards, we will provide you with helpful tips on how to repair the issues.\nCommon Reasons Why PDF Cannot Open\n1. Your Software Is Outdated\nIf your Adobe Acrobat version is outdated, then there is a high chance of the software not responding. An outdated software will have compatibility issues and can be bug-infested; your system\ncan't open pdf\nas a result.\n2. Installation Is Corrupted\nThe problem can also start from the moment you install the software on your PC consequent to a corrupted installation process. This can occur if the installation software has issues. The installation rarely completes as a result of this; you may experience a crash while the installation process is underway or the software can freeze midway, preventing a complete installation. The freezing can be a consequence of a lack of regular updates of the installation software; it can also be due to incompatibility with some other preexisting software on your PC.\n3. Enabling Protected Mode\nYour Adobe Acrobat software can fail to perform well if its performance is interfered with by the feature named “Enable Protected Mode at Startup”. The interference usually comes up in networked environments.\n4. When System Resources Are Not Sufficient\nComputers that lack adequate CPU or RAM power can have problems when running Adobe Acrobat on them. Lack of adequate resources or power will make such computers struggle in the process. The issue may not play out all the time but expect the Adobe Acrobat not to start when you have to handle multiple applications or large files at the same time.\n5. Conflicting Software\nWhen you have some third party software installed already on the computer, they can prevent Adobe Acrobat from responding. Good examples of such third party software are antivirus software and plugins.\n6. PDF Files Are Corrupted\nAdobe Acrobat is designed to help you read PDF files. Adobe Acrobat\ncan't open pdf\ndocuments if the document is corrupted. Attempting to open the PDF document can cause Adobe Acrobat to freeze midway or culminate in an outright crash.\n7. Issues of Compatibility\nYou can start experiencing compatibility issues between your computer and the Adobe Acrobat software after upgrading either of the two. Your PC’s operating system and Adobe Acrobat software must be able to work together before the software can function effectively on the PC.\n8. Presence of Background Applications\nA lot of system resources can be consumed on your computer if there are too many applications running in the background. The system can suffer performance issues, preventing Adobe Acrobat from operating effectively. The software may freeze or crash consequently.\n9. Issues With Network Drive\nIf you have stored the files for Adobe Acrobat on any network drives, the software may not respond fast if the server or network has issues. An outright network outage can cause the software to become completely unresponsive.\n10. Personal Settings And User Preferences\nYour Adobe Acrobat software can also fail to respond effectively if the settings are user preferences are not set correctly. The operational uses can cause the software to become unresponsive, which will remain so until the right settings are put in place.\nSeveral Approaches for Fixing the Issue that PDF Not Opening\n1.

To open PDF files in Windows 10 and 11, you can use the default viewer or download Adobe Reader or Acrobat.\nFollow these simple instructions to download Adobe Reader/Acrobat:\nClick on the search icon and search\nMicrosoft Store\n.\nOpen the app, and from the search area at the top, type\nAdobe reader\n.\nChoose\nAdobe Reader\nfrom the results and follow any other needed steps to download the app.\nAlternatively, you can get Adobe Acrobat from your browser using these simple guides:\nOpen your browser and type\nDownload Adobe Acrobat\n.\nClick on the\nAdobe official website\nand select\nDownload Adobe Acrobat Reader\n.\nAfter the download is complete, click on it to install.\nReasons Behind PDF Not Opening in Windows\nIf you seem to have trouble opening PDF files on your Windows computer, it is likely that it has something to do with a recent Adobe Reader or Acrobat installation/update. On the other hand, PDF not opening in Windows can also be caused by errors brought by an operating system upgrade. Here are some of the factors that may prevent you from opening files in Adobe Reader or Acrobat:\nOutdated Acrobat or Adobe Reader\nPDF files which have not been created using Adobe programs\nDamaged PDF files\nInstalled Acrobat or Adobe Reader may be damaged\nPDF files with malicious data\nStart Here: Basic Troubleshooting Steps for PDF Not Opening\nSometimes You may receive a message that says “Couldn’t open PDF” on Microsoft Edge or “Adobe Acrobat could not open…” on Adobe Reader. It is vital to know that this error can come from either Windows or the PDF file. You’ll need to change a few Windows settings if the issue is on the Windows side.\n1. Сhange the default PDF viewer\nThe first fix you must apply to solve the PDF files not opening issue is changing the default PDF viewer.  Here is a guide to help you:\nOpen your device\nSettings\nby pressing\nWindows + I\nsimultaneously.\nChoose\nApps\non the left side of your screen.\nSelect\nDefault Apps\nfrom the menu that appears.\nScroll down to\nChoose default by file type\nand click on it.\nNext, type\n.pdf\ninto the search box.\nClick on the\nMicrosoft Edge\nsearch result. A pop-up window will appear.\nClick\nSwitch anyway\nto choose another default PDF opener, preferably Adobe Acrobat.\nIf the file won’t open after changing the default viewer, try the next fix.\n2. Check if your PDF reader is up to date\nPDF readers like Adobe Acrobat Reader, Foxit Reader, or SumatraPDF frequently release updates that enhance functionality, patch security vulnerabilities, and improve compatibility with newer PDF formats.  Here’s how to update your Adobe Reader/Acrobat:\nLaunch\nAdobe Reader or Acrobat\n.\nClick\nHelp\n, then choose\nCheck For Updates\nfrom the drop-down list.\nAn update dialog box will pop out. This tool will check available updates.\nYou can automatically update to the newer version by clicking\nUpdate\n.\nRestart your computer and check if the issue has been fixed.\n3. Check the integrity of the PDF file\nSometimes, the issue isn’t with your software or system but with the PDF file.  If the PDF file was created using a malfunctioning program, then it can possibly arrive to you in a damaged form.\nAs such, you would not be able to open it using your PDF reader. On the other hand, it is possible that the file sent to you contains corrupted data. Aside from that, if the file was transferred from a flash drive or website, it is possible that it has been damaged through transit.\nFiles can become corrupted during download due to\ninternet connectivity issues\nor when being created if the software generating the PDF malfunctions.\nPRO TIP\nTry opening other PDF files with your reader; if they open without issue, the problem likely lies with the specific file. In such cases, requesting a new copy of the file from the source or attempting to download it again might solve the problem.\nYou may attempt to repair a corrupted file. One effective advanced solution involves using online tools to repair corrupted PDF files.\nAlso Read:\nHow to Find and Fix Corrupted Files in Windows 10?\nVarious reputable online services offer PDF repair tools that can fix common issues within your files, such as incomplete downloads, internal errors, or corruption from virus attacks. These tools\nanalyze the structure of your PDF,\nidentify any inconsistencies or corruptions,\nand attempt to restore the file to a usable state.\nWhile not every corrupted file can be fully recovered, these tools often salvage enough data to make the document usable again. However, it’s crucial to use only trusted online services, as uploading sensitive or confidential documents to unknown sites poses a security risk.\n4. Update your drivers\nOn the other hand, if you notice that all the files you transfer from flash drives or external storage devices seem to be damaged, then there must be something wrong with your drivers.\nPRO TIP\nAs such, we recommend using\nAuslogics Driver Updater\nto ensure that you can move PDF files with no problems. This tool will automatically update all your drivers to the latest manufacturer-recommended versions. This also means that your computer’s speed and performance will drastically improve!\n📌 Also read:\n[EASY GUIDE] How to Update Device Drivers on a Windows 10 PC?\n5. Verify compatibility and system requirements\nEnsure that your PDF reader supports the version of the PDF format of your file. Most modern readers are backward compatible with earlier versions of PDFs, but it’s still a good point to consider, especially with older software or operating systems.\nAdditionally, check that your operating system meets the minimum requirements for your PDF reader. While most PDF readers are not particularly resource-intensive, older computers might struggle with newer software versions.\n6. Adjust security settings and\npermissions\nHigh-security settings or incorrect permissions can prevent PDF files from opening correctly. For instance, your browser or PDF reader might block files downloaded from the internet for security reasons.\nYou can usually adjust these settings within the application preferences or the security section of your system settings. Here how to do it in\nAdobe Acrobat Reader:\nFor Adobe Acrobat Reader:\nOpen\nAdobe Acrobat Reader\nand\nGo to Preferences\n:\nOn the menu bar, click\nEdit\nand select\nPreferences\n(or press\nCtrl+K\n).\nClick on\nSecurity (Enhanced)\nin the categories list.\nReview the settings under\nProtected View\n.\nIf enabled, these features might restrict opening PDFs from certain locations. Consider adjusting these settings if you trust the PDF source, but be cautious as lowering security can expose your system to risks.\nBe cautious when changing security settings; ensure you’re not exposing your system to potential threats .\n7. Run a malware check\nAnother good thing to try when your PDF files won’t open is to\nrun a malware check. This can help you rule out a virus infection corrupting files on your PC. If you feel like your primary anti-virus isn’t doing a proper job, consider using\nAuslogics Anti-Malware\n, designed specifically for Windows.\nBy systematically going through these basic troubleshooting steps, you can identify and solve common issues that prevent PDF files from opening, restoring your access to important documents and information.\nFix this issue quickly\nYou can try using a safe and totally free tool developed by the Auslogics team of experts.\nA few simple steps to troubleshoot the issue:\nDownload the tiny Auslogics TroubleShooter tool.\nRun the application (no installation is needed).\nThe app will check for the issue mentioned in the article.

These methods delve deeper into resolving file corruption and compatibility issues that hinder your access to PDF documents.\nSolution one: convert PDFs to another format and then back to PDF\nThis process can sometimes bypass the issues present in the original file. Tools like Adobe Acrobat, as well as various free online conversion services, allow you to convert PDFs into formats such as Word documents or JPG images.\nCredit: Zamzar.com\nOnce converted, you can then convert these files back into PDF format. This method can eliminate problematic elements within the original PDF, essentially ‘resetting’ the file’s structure. While this might not preserve every element of the document perfectly (especially complex formatting or interactive elements), it can be a lifesaver for accessing critical information trapped within a corrupted file.\nSolution two: repair your Adobe Acrobat or Reader\nAnother reason why you can’t open PDF files is damaged Acrobat or\nReader software\n. It is possible that due to certain errors, the program cannot properly execute its functions. You can resolve this issue by repairing the version you installed on your computer. With that said, follow the instructions below:\nLaunch\nAdobe Acrobat or Reader\n.\nClick\nHelp\n.\nFrom the drop-down list, select\nRepair Installation\n.\nYou will be asked if you want to repair your currently installed Reader or Acrobat version. Click the Yes button.\nSolution three: use alternative PDF readers\nDifferent PDF readers have varying degrees of compatibility and feature sets, meaning that if one reader cannot open a particular PDF, another might. Free readers like SumatraPDF, Foxit Reader, or even web browsers like Google Chrome and Firefox offer built-in PDF viewing capabilities that might handle the file differently than your current reader.\nCredit: www.sumatrapdfreader.org\nE xperimenting with different readers can uncover compatibility issues and offer a quick workaround to access your document.\nThese advanced solutions expand your toolkit for dealing with PDF files that won’t open, offering new ways to tackle corruption, compatibility, and readability issues. Whether through repairing files, converting formats, or trying different readers, you have several strategies at your disposal to ensure you can access the information you need.\nHow to Open PDF Files in Chrome\nOpening PDF files in Google Chrome is straightforward, thanks to Chrome’s built-in PDF viewer.

These PDF files are fine when I open them with Acrobat on my Windows 7 based laptop. The PDFs always crash at the same page regardless of the app that I am using to read them.\nHas anybody else experienced this?

APPLE please listen... Using Macbook right now\nOpen PDF link using Safari... Safari downloads file then I open it in either Preview or Adobe Reader then save it... saves at 444KB. I then saved it to my idisk, opened it with my ipad using any reader and it crashes the app.\nThen, same routine, but with Firefox, same pdf open with either Preview or adobe then save and it saves as a 789kb file.... hint hint.... I save the pdf to my idisk and open in any reader app on my ipad...\nNO CRASHING! it is truly the way safari is compressing the file not the pdfs fault but the browsers treated same pdf file differently...\nSafari is more compressed, Firefox is less...\nTry it!\nReply\nLink\nUser profile for user:\n      mdrt4me\nmdrt4me\nUser level:\nLevel 1\n0 points\nMay 11, 2010 3:25 PM in response to himelys\nIn looking at the Font cache on the Ipad Under System/Library/Fonts I see no Symbol.ttf font. WEIRD!\nMost of the pdfs I am viewing have this font embedded in them via viewing properties when saved under Adobe Acrobat Professional\nSecondly once I open the same pdf on my Mac Via Preview then Save it as PDF again the file gets larger. All the fonts change to True Type Embedded Subset fonts and the Symbol font is not longer there. The Metadata has also changed from the Adobe save vs. the Preview saved file.\nAnd the Preview Save file will open properly and not crash my Ipad!!!!\nSo if you have this problem of PDFs crashing open them in Preview on your mac and resave them using preview then try to open them on your Ipad, regardless of viewer app.\nThe ipad SDK for PDF viewing is not properly handling Adobe PDF metadata nor its embedded fonts.\nApple you can contact me at mdrt4me@me.com for more info.\nThis needs fixed ASAP.\nReply\nLink\nUser profile for user:\n      Andrew Tometzki\nAndrew Tometzki\nUser level:\nLevel 1\n11 points\nJun 13, 2010 3:09 PM in response to Cameron Brandt\nI had the same issue with medical journal pdfs. I followed the advice of opening and saving all the pdfs in preview app and saving them again. Interestingly the files doubled in size but now work fine.\nIf yours are in single folder then go \"select all\" then \"open in preview\". You can then save each one to the same destination and just let it overwrite the original. Probably something to do with Adobe and Apple not talking to each other and downloads from safari being handled differently.\nBest of luck\nReply\nLink\nUser profile for user:\n      WmasVideo\nWmasVideo\nUser level:\nLevel 1\n4 points\nJul 10, 2010 9:32 PM in response to Cameron Brandt\nWhere is on this. I am not having a good experience on this. Not to mention that I tried to put a serious ID in for this but my 4 letter name kept getting rejected because it wasn't between 2 and 30 cheracters. So, I winged it.\nAnyway, I am getting ready to go to Alaska on a trip and wanted to take some of the information about my camera and other equipment Rather than taking bulky manuals it ocoured to me, What a great use for my IPAD. I started loading the PDFs and keep coming up with one, so far, that keeps crashing the IPAD. It is the users guide by NIKON for the D200 DSLR. I, surprisingly, found another person who was having the exact same problem with the same manual but using the other PDF Reader. I am using PDF Reader PRO myself. Why would the other manuals go though fine and display fine but the D200 manual crash the IPAD.

But even after uninstalling it and installing Fox It-and before that Nitro pdf readers-on my earlier Windows 7 pc, I had almost as many crashes. Practically every time I’d open a pdf on any of those apps it would throw a “not responding” message and freeze my pc until I had to close the whole program without closing the file first. Or it would freeze so hard that I’d have to hit Ctrl + Alt + Delete.\nThere’s no indication what Windows OS this user ran in 2016. I only know that no way could I deal with all of those suggested sets of troubleshooting fixes-and which may or may not have even worked.\nhttps://answers.microsoft.com/en-us...ly-crash/f271665f-0b89-495e-96d6-21b8cea55e2c\nAdobe launched the pdf 30 nearly years ago-plenty of time for Microsoft engineers to have ensured that Windows OS played far better than it never did with this long ubiquitous file format.\nMy pc has an Intel 11th gen Xeon W-1390 processor and 32GB of ECC memory.\nPlease suggest the pdf reader know to have the history with the least reported crashes.\nLast edited:\nJan 3, 2023\nSort by date\nSort by votes\nVirtualLarry\nNo Lifer\nAug 25, 2001\n56,587\n10,227\n126\nchane said:\nI am now asking Microsoft\nClick to expand...\nHello, this is Microsoft Veeeeendows, speaking.

Another possibility is the graphics driver, though it would be very useful to know if opening PDFs is the only known issue with this computer (I'd be surprised if it was).\nOne thing that surprises me a bit is an 11th gen Intel PC running Windows 10?  I would have expected it to be on Windows 11, partly because (I'd expect) that's probably what it ships with by default, and partly because Win10 has just shy of three years of security updates left.  Did this PC ship with Win10?\nUpvote\n0\nDownvote\nI\nigor_kavinski\nLifer\nJul 27, 2020\n28,174\n19,219\n146\nThe Microsoft Reader app isn't too bad either.\nReader - Free download and install on Windows | Microsoft Store\nUse Reader to open PDF, XPS and TIFF files. Reader makes it easy to view documents, search for words and phrases, take notes, fill in forms, and print or share files. Also note that this app would be retired for Windows 10 Fall Creators Update 2017 and later. We recommend Microsoft Edge for...\napps.microsoft.com\nI think it's faster than opening in a browser or Adobe's bloated reader.\nRegarding the crashes, it could be something related to PDFs, like some Windows Explorer extension added by a previously installed PDF software or maybe the antivirus hook doing crap. Uninstall anything related to PDF. If the crashes still happen, uninstall the antivirus and revert to using Windows Defender. If that also doesn't solve the issue, do a memtest86 overnight. If that comes out clear and crashes still happen, reset Windows:\nUpvote\n0\nDownvote\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nX (Twitter)\nReddit\nTumblr\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nShare\nLink\nTRENDING THREADS\nDiscussion\nZen 5 Speculation (EPYC Turin and Strix Point/Granite Ridge - Ryzen 9000)\nStarted by DisEnchantment\nSep 29, 2022\nReplies: 25K\nCPUs and Overclocking\nT\nDiscussion\nIntel Meteor, Arrow, Lunar & Panther Lakes + WCL Discussion Threads\nStarted by Tigerick\nAug 22, 2022\nReplies: 24K\nCPUs and Overclocking\nDiscussion\nIntel current and future Lakes & Rapids thread\nStarted by TheF34RChannel\nJun 18, 2017\nReplies: 23K\nCPUs and Overclocking\nDiscussion\nApple Silicon SoC thread\nStarted by Eug\nNov 10, 2020\nReplies: 11K\nCPUs and Overclocking\nQuestion\nZen 6 Speculation Thread\nStarted by IronLynx\nMay 22, 2024\nReplies: 9K\nCPUs and Overclocking\nCOMPANY\nAnandTech is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.\nVisit our corporate site\n.\n© Future Publishing Limited Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.

Opened file and it closed after several seconds. A solution that worked for me: Open file and discount from the internet or go into airplane mode. Wait a few moments and reconnect to the internet. The file stayed open and was able to edit it. This is only a partial solution as I have to discount from the internet each time I want to view/edit an Adobe file.\nLike\nReply\nJ\nJustin26592360kyea\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|3 years ago\nOctober 14, 2022\nI tried multiple things.

After opening Acrobat from the start menu this window opened up in front of the Acrobat window.

Fix Adobe Crashing Via Updating or Reinstalling Adobe Acrobat/Reader\nIf you want to fix Adobe crashing, then what you need to try is updating or reinstalling the software. There is a built-in option to check if any updates are available or not, and you can also try reinstalling the software from scratch with the guide below.\nHere is the guide to update Adobe to fix Adobe crashing issues.\nStep 1: Open Adobe Acrobat and Check for Updates\nOpen the Adobe software on your PC and click \"\nMenu\n,\" then go down to open the \"\nHelp\n\" dropdown menu and click the \"\nCheck for Updates\n\" option there. It will start checking if any updates are available for your PC, depending on the current version you have installed.\nStep 2: Let Adobe check and update if updates are available\nA pop-up window will appear that will show the progress of checking for updates availability. Once it is complete, it will show if any updates are available or not. If the update is available, you may proceed with the updating steps.\nIf the updating does not work, you can reinstall Adobe by following the below steps.\nStep 1: Go to the control panel and uninstall Adobe\nOpen Control Panel from \"\nWindows System\n\" folder in start menu on Windows PC.\nClick \"Programs\" > \"Uninstall a program\n\" locate Adobe software and right-click and click \"\nUninstall\n.\" Next, proceed with the on-screen steps to uninstall the Adobe Reader/Acrobat.\nStep 2: Install Adobe Acrobat\nThe final step is to go to Adobe Website and download the version of Acrobat/Reader that you need. Once the setup file downloads, you may install it on your computer again by following the installation steps to check if the issue is resolved yet or not.\nWay 3. Fix Adobe Reader/Acrobat Crashing Via Restarting Your Computer\nComputer software runs using RAM on your PC, and when there is an issue like memory leaks or glitches with those files on RAM, the software will crash. When you restart the computer, RAM is cleared, and those files can smoothly run again. Using this method, you can fix Adobe Acrobat crashing with the steps below:\nStep 1: Click Windows and choose restart from power options\nClick the \"\nStart Menu\n\" icon from the taskbar on your computer and click the \"\nPower\n\" option. It will show you 3 different options from where you need to select \"\nRestart\n.\" The computer will initiate the restarting process now, and you need to wait to do anything before the computer starts again. Remember to save your work on all apps and close them before restarting the computer.\nWay 4. Fix Adobe Reader/Acrobat Crashing Via Repairing Installation\nA good fix for the crashing Adobe software will be repairing the installation. This method will be useful when you don't have any updates available and you don't want to install the tool from scratch. Here are the detailed steps on how you can repair Adobe Acrobat installation:\nStep 1: Open task manager and end Adobe Acrobat task\nOpen the task manager on your PC by hitting the \"\nWindows + X\n\" keys and clicking \"\nTask Manager\n.\" In the Processes Tab, you need to locate the Adobe Acrobat process. Right-click it and click \"\nEnd Task\n.\"\nStep 2: Open Adobe Acrobat and click Repair installation\nNow, you need to open the Adobe Acrobat tool again and click \"\nMenu\n.\" Navigate to the \"\nHelp\n\" dropdown and select the \"\nRepair Installation\n\" option from there. Now, you need to follow the on-screen instructions to repair your installation, and once done, restart the computer to fix the problem.\nWay 5.  Fix Adobe Reader/Acrobat Crashing Via Clearing Cache\nThe last method that you can try to fix this issue is clearing the Cache contents of Adobe on your PC. These files can sometimes be the reason why the software keeps crashing on you, and deleting them resolves the issue with the steps below:\nStep 1: Open File Explorer and go to the Cache folder for Adobe Acrobat\nYou need to close Adobe Acrobat software on your computer first and then open the file explorer. Go to C Drive and follow the following directory:\n\"C:\\Users\\[UserName]\\AppData\\Local\\Adobe\\Acrobat\\DC\\Cache\n\"\nThe Username will be the Username you have set on your PC, while the rest of the directory will be the same.\nStep 2: Select all the contents of this folder and delete them\nInside the Cache folder, you will see some contents. Usually, there is one file, and you need to delete that. Right-click on that file and select \"\nDelete\n.\" Now, you can restart the PC and open Adobe again to check if it works or not.\nFinal Words\nAdobe Reader Crash can be very frustrating, especially when you don't have any backup tool available. If you don't want to explore any other options, then repairing Adobe Acrobat will be your only choice, and you can easily do that by using one of the methods discussed above.\nHowever, in our experience, using UPDF is a far better option than repairing other tools since it brings multiple benefits.

Windows 10 Too Buggy??\nAnonymous\n2023-01-03T03:24:31+00:00\nI’ve been too long without a pdf reader on my new Windows 10 pc, but remembering the hell of trying to run Adobe reader. But even after uninstalling it and installing Fox It-and before that Nitro pdf readers-on my earlier Windows 7 pc, I had almost as many crashes. Practically every time I’d open a pdf on any of those apps it would throw a “not responding” message and freeze my pc until I had to close the whole program without closing the file first. Or it would freeze so hard that I’d have to hit Ctrl + Alt + Delete.\nThere’s no indication what Windows OS this user ran in 2016. I only know that no way could I deal with all of those suggested sets of troubleshooting fixes-and which may or may not have even worked.\nhttps://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/all-pdf-readers-constantly-crash/f271665f-0b89-495e-96d6-21b8cea55e2c\nAdobe launched the pdf 30 nearly years ago-plenty of time for Microsoft engineers to have ensured that Windows OS played far better than it never did with this long ubiquitous file format.\nMy pc has an Intel 11^th^ gen Xeon W-1390 processor and 32GB of ECC memory.\nSo, to avoid any such time wasting and aggravating ****, I am now asking Microsoft: Which is the pdf reader know to have the history with the least reported crashes??\nWindows for home | Windows 10 | Performance and system failures\nWindows for home | Windows 10 | Performance and system failures\nSign in to follow\nLocked Question.\nThis question was migrated from the Microsoft Support Community.

I'm Greg, here to help you with this.\nThere's no need to use a PDF Reader unless you want it, all browsers now open PDF files.  Just change the default for PDF Files in Windows Settings > Apps > Default Apps > Choose Default by File Type > PDF to your browser and it should work.\nIf not then I'll help you repair the browser since it's the same repairs as for browsing the web.\nFeel free to ask back any questions. Based on the detailed results you post back, I will have other suggestions if necessary.\n______________________________________________\nStandard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

PDF documents can take a while to open and when scrolling, Adobe Reader can freeze and, occasionally close down altogether.\nThe behaviour is not consistent but if you encounter it with a file you're using, the following suggestions will help you to view the page more easily.\nDisable protected mode on startup\nClick on\nEdit\n>\nPreferences\nand then in the left hand pane select the\nGeneral\noption (in\nAcrobat Reader X\n) or the\nSecurity (enhanced)\noption (in\nAcrobat Reader XI\n) and untick the option \"Enable Protected Mode at startup\" then click OK\nThis reduces the time it takes for Adobe to launch and should address problems with the application appearing to \"freeze\" when you first open it, but if you still have problems, try:\nDisable the page preview on the scrollbar.\nClick on\nView\n>\nPage Display\n>\nEnable scrolling\nThis turns off the little page preview which appears next to the scroll bar if you scroll through the document by clicking and dragging. This preview can cause a noticeable lag, especially if you drag a long distance.\nTry saving the file locally on the computer you are using.\nSometimes network delays can be the cause of a slow response so if you want to be able to go backwards and forwards through a file quickly, for example in a lecture, you could temporarily save the file locally on the computer:\nChoose\nFile\n>\nSave As\nand choose\nComputer\nSave the file in\nC:\\Temp\\\nThe file will be deleted automatically the next time the computer is shut down but you can also delete it manually when you have finished with it if it contains confidential information\nTry a different file viewer.\nAdobe PDF Reader is a relatively large program which can run slowly - but there are other programs that can view PDFs. For example, the Google Chrome browser which is installed on all student PCs and computers in lecture rooms has its own built-in PDF viewer. You can open a PDF in Chrome as follows:\ngo to the location where your PDF file is stored\nright-click on the file and choose\nOpen with\nif\nGoogle Chrome\nis shown as one of the options, click on it to open the PDF\nif not, click on\nChoose default program…\nclick on\nBrowse...\nand go to\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\nclick on\nchrome.exe\nand then click the\nOpen\nbutton\nif you want to use\nChrome\nto open all PDFs in future, leave the option\nAlways use the selected program...\nticked (or you can un-tick it if you just want to try\nChrome\nbefore

I opened an Adobe PDF document I needed for work and it wouldn't let me sign in or open/print the document.   I cannot shut it down or fore quit.   I have been on hold with Adobe for 4 1/2 hours.   I have several documents I need (PDF) to do my job and I can't open or close Adobe Acrobat Reader.... I may get fired!  At 1pm Adobe guaranteed me a \"support\" call-back by 3pm.   It is now 4:30pm and I called again and have been on hold for 45 minutes.   How do I get Adobe Acrobat Reader to close on my MacBook Pro?   I tried moving the application to my trash and it won't let me because the program is open.   Adobe just said there are known issues but with COVID in India, \"they are working on it\".

Reboot your Mac and see if the problem persists. Are these exceptionally large corporate PDFs with images?

The latest Windows version has a bug in the PDF viewer:1) the highlight is still faint if we have dark mode activate. This doesn't happen in the light mode.\nAs a suggestion: Reading PDFs in Dark Mode is painful, could those of us who love using Zotero in Dark Mode have a Toggle to set the PDF Reader to show PDF documents in either Light or Dark Mode according to user preference for better experience?\nThanks\nAbeJellinek\nZotero Team\nOctober 18, 2024\n1. Can you make sure you're on the final release version of 7.0.8? That bug was present in some of the betas but has been fixed.\n2. View -> Use Dark Mode for Content\nZoteroUser7\nOctober 18, 2024\nThanks for your response.\nI am on the most current version for Windows, which was released today (7.0.8 64-bit).\nCurrently, my View menu doesn't offer the option to 'Use Dark Mode for Content':\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/zotero.org/images/forums/u15459454/r2cn2zfm1zbqnfb14xfu.png\nAbeJellinek\nZotero Team\nOctober 18, 2024\nThat option only shows in reader tabs.\ndstillman\nZotero Team\nOctober 19, 2024\nedited October 19, 2024\n@ZoteroUser7\n: For the highlighting, can you provide a screenshot?\nZoteroUser7\nDecember 12, 2024\nThanks everyone.

A workaround of disabling hardware acceleration is provided.","raw_content":"New PDF reader bug - Zotero Forums\nNew PDF reader bug\nwarguelles\nMay 6, 2021\nI have detected a problem with the PDF reader, which I presume may be a bug. The figures of the following reference are not displayed correctly: 1/4 of a black circle appears in the upper left corner of each figure. If I open the same file with Acrobat Reader, I don't see any problem.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/pj.2010.121\nThanks!\nmartynas_b\nZotero Team\nMay 7, 2021\n@warguelles\nCould you provide screenshots of specific PDF part that is rendered incorrectly and also the correct version of it.\nwarguelles\nMay 8, 2021\n@martynas_b\nHere is a link to a folder containing screenshots of the above document, opened with the new Zotero reader and with Acrobat\nhttps://app.box.com/s/c4nrfjbqi6g7dljp5t5gp5p7ztf0swvt\nThese quarter black circles appear in ALL figures of this document.\nThanks for your attention!\nwarguelles\nMay 8, 2021\n@martynas_b\nHere are examples of other papers with the same problem:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2016.02.037\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.09.078\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.04.006\nI only came across this problem within this journal in a few years around 2015. Maybe that can help you.\nmartynas_b\nZotero Team\nMay 10, 2021\n@warguelles\nI can't reproduce this, at least with the file that I can access. You could send the specific file to support@zotero.org also referencing this thread.\nCould you test if that happens on other computers? Also if that happens when opening the PDF file with\nhttps://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html\n?\nwarguelles\nMay 10, 2021\n@martynas_b\nI have sent the files by email.\nYes, the same happens when I open them with Firefox, but not with chromium based browsers like Google Chrome or Edge.\nmartynas_b\nZotero Team\nMay 10, 2021\n@warguelles\nThanks. But I still can't reproduce this. Could you test if the issue appears on another computer? There is a chance this is related with your hardware/OS/drivers.\nwarguelles\nMay 10, 2021\nedited May 10, 2021\n@martynas_b\nYes, I tested with the PC of my wife... The same as with mine! :(\nEdited:\nIntel core i5, W10 Home 20H2, Firefox and Zotero-beta updated\nmartynas_b\nZotero Team\nMay 10, 2021\n@warguelles\nIt might just be a guess, but it can be this\nissue\n. Could you download and test the mentioned PDF file and tell us if you see the wrong one, or the correct one screenshot?\nNext, you can try going to Zotero Preferences->Advanced->Config Editor and setting layers.acceleration.disabled to true.\nwarguelles\nMay 10, 2021\n@martynas_b\nYessssss!\nYou did it! Everything is fine now, thank you so much!\nben_tif\nAugust 4, 2023\nI also experience these same black circles. I have modern hardware (5800X, RTX 3080) with acceleration on. I find that 1/4 black circles appear on every image embedded within a PDF file preview. Every single one, no matter the PDF. I'd prefer to use my hardware's acceleration, rather than disabling it... but I will if that's the only way to fix this.\ndstillman\nZotero Team\nAugust 4, 2023\nThis is fixed in the\nZotero 7

Let’s dive in!\nKey Takeaways\nPDF files fail to open due to outdated readers, corrupted files, incorrect file associations, password protection, unsupported file types, or incomplete downloads caused by interrupted internet connections.\nOn Windows, to fix the opening issue, install an updated PDF reader, set it as default in Settings, and run malware scans.\nOn Mac, resolve problems by setting Preview as default, re-downloading files, verifying the .pdf extension, and scanning for viruses with CleanMyMac.\nCorrupted PDFs can be repaired by updating reader software, restoring previous file versions, or converting to Word format and back using reliable tools.\nOnline PDF editors like pdf.net provide instant cross-device access without troubleshooting and handle large documents without performance issues.\n6 Reasons Why PDF Doesn’t Open\nHere are the most common reasons why a PDF file doesn’t open:\nOutdated PDF reader\n: PDF technology constantly evolves with new features, and older software may not understand these updates. Simply put, if your reader is outdated, it may not recognize a file using advanced functions like digital signatures. As a common PDF reader problem, this can either cause the file not to display properly or fail to open at all.\nCorrupted PDF file\n: Your system crashing or power failing can disrupt the creation, transfer, or saving of a PDF file and corrupt it. This is known as a PDF file error—it essentially means that the\nfile’s structure\nis broken so that no program can read it properly. As a result, the original data may be lost, and you may be unable to open the file.\nIncorrect file association\n: If your device uses an incompatible program to open a PDF file, you’ll likely see an error or a page with incoherent text. This doesn’t mean the PDF isn’t readable—the issue lies with how the device interprets it. For example, if your computer tries to open a PDF file in a text editor, this means the file association is wrong.\nPassword-protected PDF\n: A PDF document containing sensitive information is likely to be secured with a password. Needless to say, if you don't enter the correct password, the file won't open, and even a minor typo can prevent you from accessing it.\nUnsupported file type\n: There’s a chance that the PDF document you’re trying to open isn’t a PDF at all. Your reader may not recognize its format, or the file may have the wrong extension. This error can occur if the file was incorrectly renamed or saved using software or settings not typically used for PDFs. The error message may resemble one shown for a corrupted file.\nIncomplete file download\n: If something interrupts a PDF file download (like your internet disconnecting), said file won’t fully transfer to your device. When you try to open it, your reader will detect its missing parts, and the PDF will fail to load. This can result in the file appearing unusually small or not opening at all.\nHow to Fix PDF Files Not Opening on Different Platforms\nNow, let’s see how to fix PDF files not opening on different platforms, including Windows, Mac, and mobile devices:\nOpening PDFs on Windows\nThe default PDF viewer in Windows is Microsoft Edge. However, it may fail to load a file if there’s a problem with your system. In that case, you’ll need to change a few Windows settings to fix PDF opening issues.\nHere’s how you can do that:\nOpen the\nMicrosoft Store\nand search for a PDF reader.\nChoose the PDF reader you want to install from the drop-down menu.\nClick on the\nGet\nbutton and install the program.\nWhen the installation process is done, the word on the button will turn from\nGet\nto\nInstalled\n.\nOpen the\nStart Menu\nand navigate to\nSettings\n.\nClick on\nApps\nand then choose the\nDefault Apps\noption from the side menu.\nTap on\nChoose default apps by file type\n.\nLocate\n.pdf\non the list and set your chosen reader as the default app.\nIf you run into a similar problem in the future and your PDF doesn’t open when you double-click on it, one of the following fixes might do the trick:\nUpdate your reader\n. Launch the program you use to open PDF files and check for updates. If a newer version of the reader is available, you can get it by tapping on\nUpdate\n.\nEnsure that the file is properly downloaded and has the right extension\n. Try opening a different PDF from the one that’s been causing you problems. If you’re successful, the issue is with the file, not your reader. In this case, try re-downloading the file or manually changing its extension to .pdf.\nCheck if the file has a virus\n. PDFs can have viruses that corrupt them, so you should run a malware check to rule this out as a possibility. To do this, open the\nWindows Security\napp and choose the\nCustom scan\noption to check a specific file.\nOpening PDFs on Mac\nIf your PDF won’t open on Mac, the issue may lie within the system or the file itself. Either way, here are some helpful tips on how to resolve it:\nIn case your PDF won’t open in\nPreview\n, which is the default Mac app for opening PDF documents, another program may have been set as default. To fix this issue, right-click on the file, select\nOpen With\n, and choose\nPreview\nfrom the list that opens up.\nIf you still can’t open your PDF, the file may not have been downloaded properly. To rule this out, try deleting it from your device and\ntransferring or downloading it again\n.\nAs previously mentioned, if the issue isn’t with the system settings or the download process, it’s likely with the file itself. First, check its extension—it should be .pdf. If it’s not, select the file, tap on the\nenter/return\nkey, and rename the extension.\nAlternatively, the document you’re trying to open may carry a virus. You can check if it does by opening the\nCleanMyMac\napp, choosing the\nProtection\noption from the sidebar, and selecting\nScan\n.\nOpening PDFs on Mobile Devices\nIf your PDF won’t open on an iPhone or Android, here’s what may be the problem and how to fix it:\nCheck if your device has an app that can open PDF files. While some phones come with built-in readers, others require you to download one from the\nGoogle Play\nor\nApple Store\nmanually.\nYou may have lost a Wi-Fi connection, and your mobile data may be off. In this scenario, the file you’re trying to open likely hasn’t been fully downloaded. Make sure you have a\nsecure connection\nand try downloading it again.\nIf your phone has a basic built-in reader, you’ll probably have trouble opening files with advanced features. If this is the case, you’ll need to\ndownload a feature-rich app\neven if you have a preinstalled PDF reader.\nThe app you use for opening PDFs may be outdated and thus unable to load newer files. To fix this,\nupdate it manually\nto the latest version.\nHow to Open a PDF File in a Browser\nLet’s see how to open a PDF file in a browser, be it Chrome, Firefox, or Safari:\nChrome\n:\nOpen the Chrome browser.\nTap on the three dots in the upper right corner and select\nSettings\n.\nChoose the\nPrivacy and security\noption from the side menu and select\nSite settings\n.\nClick on\nAdditional content settings\nand select\nPDF documents\n.\nCheck the\nOpen PDFs in Chrome\noption.\nFirefox\n:\nOpen the Firefox browser.\nTap on the three horizontal lines in the upper right corner and choose\nSettings\nfrom the drop-down menu.\nScroll down to the\nFiles and Applications\nsection.\nSelect\nPortable Document Format (PDF)\nand choose the\nOpen in Firefox\noption.\nSafari\n:\nOpen the Safari browser.\nDrag the PDF file you want to open into the Safari window.\nAlternatively, choose the\nOpen File\noption under\nFile\nand select the desired document.\nIf the PDF file isn’t saved on your device, enter its URL or click on the link, and Safari will open it in the browser window.\nWhy Won't a Browser Open My PDF?\nThere can be many reasons why your PDF won’t open in Chrome or another browser, from a slow internet connection to a disabled PDF viewer.\nLet’s explore them in more detail and see how to repair a PDF not opening in a browser:\nSlow Internet connection\n: If you’re trying to open a large PDF file, a slow Internet connection can make it seem like the browser can’t load it. In this scenario, you can either wait for the file to load or download it directly.\nFile name or location issue\n: The browser may fail to open a file with special characters in its name or a complex path. To fix this, try renaming the document to something simpler and moving it to a folder with a basic path.\nOutdated browser\n: If you have an older version of a browser, it may not open PDFs properly (or support the format at all). In this case, you can update your browser or download an extension for PDF support.\nSecurity settings\n: Your browser may block PDFs due to security settings. To solve this problem, you can change these settings to allow PDF access or temporarily\ndisable pop-up blockers\n.\nDisabled PDF viewer\n: Your browser may have been set to only download PDFs instead of opening them. You can change this in settings by enabling the built-in PDF viewer.\nHow to Fix a Corrupt PDF\nLet’s see how to fix a corrupt PDF since this is one of the main causes of a PDF not opening:\nThe problem behind a corrupt PDF may be an outdated reader. In this case, all you need to do is\nupdate the program to the latest available version\n. Check for updates, and if there are any available, install them.\nAnother problem with your reader may be in its files—these might be corrupted. You can fix this by selecting the\nRepair installation\noption.\nIf the file worked up to a certain point, then it may be its current version that’s corrupted. To solve this problem, right-click on the file and choose the\nRestore previous versions\noption. Select one of the backed-up versions from the list to restore it.\nIf there’s no older version, you can\nconvert the corrupted\nPDF file to Word\nor another format\n. This way, you’ll ensure no important information is lost, and you can easily convert the Word document back to PDF using a trusted online editor such as pdf.net.\nIf You’re Having Trouble Opening PDFs, Try Pdf.net\nYou can open a PDF file online instead of wasting time trying to figure out why it won’t load otherwise. All you need is a trusted\nPDF editor\n, and pdf.net is the ideal choice.

FAQ\n#1. How do I recover a PDF that won’t open?\nTo recover a PDF that won’t open, try changing its extension or re-downloading it. If that doesn’t work, the problem may be with your reader.

This article aims to guide IT professionals, especially those in help desk roles, through a detailed process of resolving such issues. We will explore the steps necessary to diagnose and fix the problem, ensuring a smooth and efficient resolution.\nUnderstanding the Issue\nWhen a user reports that PDF files are not opening, it could be due to various reasons ranging from software issues to incorrect file associations. Here’s a systematic approach to address this:\n1. Preliminary Checks\nVerify the Problem\n: Confirm if the issue is with all PDF files or specific ones. This helps determine if the problem is with the file itself or the PDF reader application.\nCheck for Error Messages\n: Ask the user for any specific error messages that appear when trying to open a PDF. This can give clues about the root cause.\n2. Ensuring PDF Reader Installation\nCheck for Adobe Reader\n: The most common tool for reading PDFs is Adobe Reader. Ensure it’s installed on the user’s system. If not, proceed to install it, considering the organization’s software policies.\nAlternative PDF Readers\n: In some cases, alternative PDF readers might be in use, like opening PDF on chrome browser. Verify their presence or install them if needed.\n3. Managing File Associations\nSetting Correct Associations\n: Sometimes, the issue arises from PDFs not being associated with any reader application. Guide the user through setting Adobe Reader or any other preferred PDF reader as the default application for PDF files.\nWindows Settings Adjustment\n: On a Windows machine, you can change file associations by going to\n‘Settings’ > ‘Apps’ > ‘Default apps’\nand scrolling down to choose default applications by file type.\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nAppropriate PDF Viewer Setting via PDF File:\nThe sequence\n“Open with -> Choose another app -> Adobe PDF Viewer -> Always”\nis a pathway through the Windows interface to set Adobe PDF Viewer as the default application for opening PDF files. This means that every time you open a PDF file, it will automatically open in Adobe PDF Viewer.\n4. Dealing with Corrupted PDF Files\nFile Integrity Check\n: If the issue is with specific files, there’s a possibility that these files are corrupted. Try opening different PDF files to confirm this.\nRe-download or Request Resend\n: If a file is corrupted, the best approach is to re-download the file or ask the sender to resend it.\n5. Updating or Reinstalling PDF Reader\nUpdate the Application\n: Out-of-date PDF readers can lead to compatibility issues. Check for updates and install them.\nReinstallation\n: If updating doesn’t resolve the issue, reinstall the PDF reader. This can fix any underlying issues with the application itself.\n6. Advanced Troubleshooting\nCheck for Conflicting Software\n: Other installed software might conflict with the functioning of PDF readers. Look for recently installed applications and consider temporary deactivation to diagnose the issue.\nUse IT Support Tools\n: Utilize remote desktop tools to directly access the user’s system (with permission) for more in-depth troubleshooting.\n7. Providing User Education\nGuidance and Best Practices\n: Educate the user about managing and updating their PDF reader and the importance of not downloading PDFs from untrusted sources to avoid similar issues in the future.\n8. Documentation and Follow-Up\nLogging the Issue\n: Document the problem and the steps taken to resolve it. This is crucial for future reference and helps in identifying recurring issues.\nFollow-Up\n: Ensure the issue is resolved by following up with the user. This step is essential for quality service and user satisfaction.\nConclusion\nTroubleshooting ‘PDF Files Don’t Open’ issues requires a mix of technical know-how and effective communication skills.

The built-in PDF viewer introduced with Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Apple Safari and Google Chrome\ndo not support\nXFA-based PDF forms. Therefore, XFA-based PDF forms do not open and will prompt you to upgrade your Adobe PDF Reader to the latest version in later versions of these browsers.  In most cases after upgrading your Reader the message still appears.\nHere are some resources that will allow you to use the Adobe Reader instead of the built-in PDF browser version:\nOpening XFA-based PDF Forms\nAnother alternative way is to follow the steps outlined in the \"Trouble Printing, Viewing and Saving PDF Files\" section and download the document to your machine or device.  Then you can open that document from your

Chrome: Troubleshooting PDF Viewer in Chrome\nThis article describes different methods by which you may be able to correct issues\n                           with PDFs not displaying properly in your Google Chrome browser.\nChrome not Displaying PDF's Properly\nTry Updating Chrome\nGoogle is quick to fix bugs with Chrome, so first make sure that you're using the\n                           most up to date version of the browser. To do that, first open the Chrome menu and\n                           select Help > About Google Chrome.\nIf there is an update, it will automatically start to download. If you have the most\n                           current version, it will show \"Google Chrome is up to date\" on the About page.\nClear Browser Cache and Cookies\nAn outdated or corrupted browser cache is a common reason for elements on a web page,\n                           including PDFs, to not display correctly. Clearing your browser cache should prompt\n                           your browser to download up to date content and hopefully fix the issue with rendering\n                           your PDFs properly.  Please note that you will likely have to sign back into websites\n                           in Chrome once you've cleared your browser cookies.\nTo clear your cache and cookies in Google Chrome, first go to the Chrome menu in the\n                           upper right and select More Tools > Clear browsing data or press CTRL+SHIFT+DEL to\n                           bring up the Clear browsing data menu. Make sure that Cookies and Cached images and\n                           files are checked and then click the CLEAR DATA button.\nEnable Adobe Acrobat Reader Chrome Extension\nIf you have Acrobat Reader installed on your computer and set as the default PDF reader,\n                           you'll be prompted to install the Acrobat Reader Extension when you launch Acrobat\n                           Reader. Once you install the extension in Chrome by following the installation instructions\n                           that appear, you will have to enable the extension in Chrome.\nTo enable the extension, first click on the yellow \"!\" icon that appears in the upper\n                           right of your Chrome window. Then you can click the Enable extension button to allow\n                           it to work in Chrome. Once you do, when you open a PDF in Chrome, you can click the\n                           prompt that appears to open the PDF with Acrobat Reader instead.\nChrome Automatically Downloading PDF's\nDisable Automatic PDF download\nIf Chrome is automatically downloading PDFs instead of opening them in Chrome, you\n                           can disable the force download setting by going to\nchrome://settings/content/pdfDocuments\nand disabling the switch next to Download PDF files instead of automatically opening\n                           them in Chrome. Once you do, PDFs should now open in Chrome instead of automatically\n                           downloading. Certain PDFs may still download automatically if the file is listed as\n                           an attachment on the website, which will trigger it to download no matter

with opening or reading PDF files, including missing PDF readers, file extensions, and corrupted files. It provides steps to test for a working PDF reader and suggests free alternative readers.","raw_content":"Unable to Open or Read a PDF File\nSkip to Main Content\nUnable to open or read a PDF file\nUpdated:\n09/07/2025\nby\nComputer Hope\nNo PDF reader installed\nBefore moving on to the following sections, make sure you have a functional PDF (Portable Document Format) reader program installed. As a quick test, click the Adobe PDF icon to the right. If you have a working PDF reader, an example PDF should open in a new window. If it doesn't,\ndownload Adobe Reader\nor try an alternative free PDF reader. If you don't want to install any programs, an online reader is your best solution.\nFree alternative PDF readers to Adobe Reader.\nTip\nUpdating your PDF reader may resolve many basic issues. Always verify you have the latest version installed.\nPDF is not recognizable\nIn some situations, the file extension Microsoft Windows uses to identify the file as a PDF may be stripped away when it is sent through e-mail. If the file does not end in .pdf, Microsoft Windows does not know how to open the file. To determine if this is your issue, follow the steps below.\nSave the PDF\nto your computer's\ndesktop\n.\nOpen your PDF reader\n. Found through the\nStart menu\n.\nDrag\nthe saved PDF from the computer desktop to the reader. If the file is valid, it should open.\nFile is corrupt\nIf the example PDF opened when you clicked the image above, but the suggestion did not help, your PDF file may be corrupt. Re-download the PDF or, if it's an attachment, request that the e-mail be sent again. There are also some software utilities to \"fix\" a corrupted PDF, though none we fully recommend at the time of this writing.

Double-check the file's location to confirm it's accessible.\n2.\nTry an Alternative PDF Viewer:\nIf you're using a dedicated PDF viewer or application for PDF files, try opening the file with a different PDF reader. Popular options include Adobe Acrobat Reader, SumatraPDF, or built-in PDF viewers in web browsers.\n3.\nUpdate Your PDF Viewer:\nEnsure your PDF viewer or reader is not an outdated version. Outdated software may not be compatible with certain PDF files, leading to issues. Check for updates to the latest version to access new features and compatibility improvements.\n4.\nCheck for File Corruption:\nA corrupt file may not open correctly and will give a PDF error. Try opening other PDF files to see if the issue is specific to one file or a recurring problem. If it's just one file, consider obtaining a fresh copy.\n5.\nBrowser PDF Viewer:\nIf you're trying to open a PDF within a web browser and it's not working, try downloading the PDF and opening it with a dedicated PDF viewer. Browser PDF viewers can sometimes encounter compatibility issues.\n6.\nDisable Browser Extensions:\nBrowser extensions or add-ons can sometimes interfere with PDF viewing. Disable or uninstall any extensions that might be causing conflicts with PDFs.\n7.\nClear Browser Cache:\nIf you're opening PDFs in a web browser and facing problems, clear your browser's cache and cookies. This can resolve issues related to cached data.\n8.\nPDF Repair Process Tools:\nThere are various file repair tools available that can repair or recover corrupted PDF files. Consider using one of these tools to attempt file recovery if you suspect the PDF is damaged.\n9.\nOperating System Updates:\nEnsure your operating system is up to date with the latest updates and patches. Sometimes, system updates can resolve compatibility issues related to PDF rendering.\n10.\nSecurity Software:\nCheck if your\nantivirus or security software is blocking the PDF file. Some security software can flag PDF files as potential threats. Adjust settings or temporarily disable the security software to test if it's causing the problem.\nCan't Open PDF:\nTroubleshooting FAQs\nStill have questions after our detailed guide?

I can navigate to the location where the executable file is stored (C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Acrobat DC\\Acrobat), but when I attemt to launch it I get an error: Windows cannot find C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Acrobat DC\\Acrobat\\Acrobat.exe. If I attempt to open a PDF document directly by double clicking the file, I get a similar error that it cannot find the document file.\nI have loaded the browser based version of Acrobat, but documents will not automatically open in that version and I find it difficult to use. I can open PDF files in Microsoft Edge, but my ability to fill in and sign files is not available via the browser plugin.\nI have tried multiple times to uninstall/reinstall the Reader app, but it will still not launch.\nView PDF\nWindows\nLike\nB\nS\n13 people like this\nReply\nSubscribe\nThis topic has been closed for replies.\nAbambo\nCommunity Expert\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nJanuary 19, 2024\nIs it only Acrobat that does not want to start?\nUninstall — run AcroCleaner\nAcroCleaner — Acrobat Desktop Tools and Utilities\n— Download the latest Reader (important!) — Install\nABAMBO | Hard- and Software Engineer | Photographer\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nD\nD-E-P\nAuthor\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nJanuary 20, 2024\nThanks for the feedback. I ran the uninstall followed by running AcroCleaner as stated in the instructions and then rebooted. I had a repeating error with my backup tool from Seagate which I solved by deleting the Seagate Toolkit software. I installed Acrobat Reader and attempted to launch it. I still get the same error - screenshot attached.  I think there may be a conflict with Adobe Acrobat Pro free trial. I am attempting to remove that - althought there is only Adobe Acrobat (64 bit) listed in my Programs and Features list for removal. I've cancelled the trial and unsubscribed from the PDF Pack. I am rerunning the uninstall and cleaner process and reinstall Reader once again.\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nD\nD-E-P\nAuthor\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nJanuary 20, 2024\nStill didn't work.

Acrobat Reader DC works fine, the problem is with the pro version installed by creative cloud.

When I created I new one, Acrobat DC Pro was working. But the I logged in my microsoft account again, that account that stores all your preferences of windows 10, connect your license/activation of windows 10 to your email etc.\nThen Acrobat DC Pro got problematic again. The same behaviour of opening and after 1 second shutting down with the recent files areas totally black. So, in conclusion, It was something related with my microsoft account/profile.

Mode, and repairing the installation.","raw_content":"5 Fixes for Adobe Acrobat Reader Not Opening in Windows 11/10 - Guiding Tech\nHelping millions of people navigate the world of technology.\n60M+\nAnnual Readers\n6,000+\nGuides and Reviews\n5,400+\nTech Videos\nQuick Tips\nStandard users will need admin credentials to run programs as administrators.\nYou can also use the Adobe Acrobat extension in Microsoft Edge to open PDF files with Acrobat features.\nAdobe Acrobat Reader and Adobe Acrobat Reader DC are the same and include Document Cloud (DC) integration.\nBefore starting the fixes, please note that Adobe Acrobat Reader DC and Adobe Acrobat Reader are the same now. When we discussed this with the Adobe support team, they explained that “DC” means Document Cloud and this functionality is integrated into the current version of Adobe Acrobat Reader.\nFix 1: Run as Administrator\nStep 1:\nRight-click the Acrobat Reader DC shortcut on your desktop and click\nRun as Administrator.\nIn the\nUser Account Control\ndialog box that appears, click\nYes\n.\nStep 2:\nIf Acrobat Reader DC launches appropriately, configure the shortcut to run the program with administrative rights. Start by right-clicking the Acrobat Reader DC shortcut. Then, click\nProperties.\nStep 3:\nSwitch to the\nShortcu\nt tab > click the\nAdvanced\nbutton. Now, check the box for\nRun as administrator\nand apply the changes in the Advanced Properties pop-up.\nFix 2: Stop Acrobat Reader From Running in the Background\nIs Acrobat Reader DC still failing to open? Ending all background processes related to the program can help. It will ensure that it gets a fresh start.\nStep 1:\nOpen Task Manager using\nCtrl + Shift + Esc\nand switch\nto the\nProcesses\ntab.\nStep 2:\nType\nAdobe Acrobat\nin the search box at the top.\nStep 3:\nIt will only show you Adobe Acrobat-related processes.\nRight-click\non each and select\nEnd task.\nOnce done, open the Acrobat Reader DC again. It should also\nresolve the full-screen issue on Acrobat Reader\n.\nFix 3: Unblock File if downloaded From the Internet\nMost\nfiles that we download from the Internet are blocked. You can unblock them from the properties window.\nStep 1: Right-click\non the PDF file and select\nProperties\n.\nStep 2:\nUnder the\nGeneral\ntab, check the box for\nUnblock\n.\nStep 3:\nApply the changes, and when you open the file, it should not have any issue with permission.\nFix 4: Disable Protected Mode in Adobe Acrobat Reader\nAcrobat Reader DC uses Protected Mode to secure your computer against malicious PDF documents. In rare instances, Protected Mode can also prevent the program from loading, especially if the\ncertificates have issues\n; hence, try disabling it.\nSince you obviously can’t open Acrobat Reader DC to disable Protected mode, you must use the Registry Editor.\nStep 1:\nPress\nWindows+R\n, type\nregedit\n,\nand click\nOK\nto open the System Registry.\nStep 2:\nCopy the following path into the\naddress bar\nof the Registry Editor window and press\nEnter\n:\nComputer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Adobe\\Acrobat Reader\\DC\\Privileged\nStep 3:\nDouble-click the registry entry labeled\nbProtectedMode\n.\nStep 4:\nSet the value to\n0\nand click\nOK\n.\nFix 5: Repair Acrobat Reader\nIf you still have issues, you must reinstall Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. However, repairing Acrobat Reader is an excellent option before you do that.\nStep 1:\nOpen\nWindows Settings\n(Win + I) and navigate to\nApps\n.\nStep 2:\nClick the\nthree-dot menu\nand select\nModify\nto launch the Adobe Acrobat repair module.\nStep 3:\nClick the\nNext\nbutton, select\nRepair\n, and click\nNext\nagain.\nStep 4:\nClick the\nUpdate\nbutton. The installer will validate the installation, download the file if necessary, and replace the existing one.\nStep 5:\nOnce completed, click the\nFinish\nbutton and open Adobe Acrobat to check if the issue has been resolved.\nIf this doesn’t work, use the same method but choose to uninstall it this time. Once done, reinstall the app and check if the issue is resolved.\nWas this helpful?\nSubmit\nCancel\nThanks for your feedback!\nLast updated on 29 April, 2024\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nRead Next\nHow to Enable Scrolling By Default in Adobe Acrobat DC and Reader DC\nSwitching to your preferred page mode in Adobe Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC often disables continuous scrolling.\nHow to Fit Full Page to Window By Default in Adobe Acrobat DC and Reader DC\nAdobe Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC prefer fitting pages by width.\n​How to Open Files in Separate Windows on Adobe Acrobat Pro, Standard, and Reader DC​\nThe tabbed-view in Adobe Acrobat Pro, Standard, and Reader DC is a mixed bag.\nHow to Disable or Remove Recent Files in Adobe Reader and Acrobat DC\nRemove Recent Files in Adobe Reader Desktop Step 1: On the Recent list, hover over the shortcut you want to delete.\nHow to Hide or Remove the Adobe Reader DC Tools Pane Permanently\nJust launch a PDF in Adobe Reader DC, and you should find a Tools pane pop up to the right of the screen.\nTop 4 Ways to Open PDF Document in Adobe Reader Instead of Browser\nAre your PDF files opening in the Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 PC?\nHow to Add or Remove PDF Background Using Adobe Acrobat\nChange Background in a PDF File If you have an Adobe Acrobat Pro subscription, you can change the background color of your PDF using the Edit PDF tool.\nLooking for Adobe Acrobat Alternative?

Read on to find out how!\nLink copied!\nAdobe Acrobat has been one of the most dependable PDF software for a very long time. Despite the recent influx of several new applications that perform similar functions, it has remained a favorite among users. However, there have been a few complaints of late that Adobe Acrobat keeps crashing. Why does this happen? And more importantly, what can be done to keep it from happening so much? That is exactly what we are going to talk about in this article today.\nWhy Does Adobe Acrobat Keep Crashing?\nIt doesn't happen very often, and it certainly doesn't happen to everybody. But if you have experienced that your Adobe Acrobat keeps crashing, it can be a major source of frustration. Imagine being right in the middle of editing a PDF document and the software just crashes. Everything you've done so far could be lost, and the delay could make you miss important deadlines.\nBefore we take a look at possible solutions, it’s important to first understand why your Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Acrobat DC keeps crashing. This step is key to choosing the right method for solving the problem. With that being said, here are the most common reasons.\n1. There are issues within the operating system that are causing Adobe Acrobat to crash\nOperating system updates may sometimes cause disruptions in the normal operation of Adobe Acrobat, causing it to crash.\n2. The system files for Adobe Acrobat have been corrupted\nEven though they were perfectly fine during the time of installation, system files can sometimes get corrupted over time. This may be the case if your Adobe Acrobat keeps crashing, despite running smoothly on previous occasions.\n3. Your PC does not meet the hardware specifications for Adobe Acrobat\nAdobe Acrobat requires a certain amount of hard disk space and RAM, as well as compatible graphics drivers in order to function properly. If your PC is lacking in any of these specs, frequent crashes are likely.\n4. Your existing Adobe Acrobat version is outdated\nAdobe releases new versions from time to time in order to make improvements to the existing software or to fix bugs that they have discovered. Sticking with an old version can put you at risk of experiencing various issues, such as crashes or non-responsiveness.\nEffective Methods for Fixing the Issue\nMethod 1: Update your Adobe Acrobat Software\nIn many cases, simply updating the software will solve the problem of intermittent crashing. First, check if there are updates available by clicking Help on the menu, then clicking Check for Updates.\nThe program will let you know if updates are available, in which case you just need to install them. The detailed procedure for updater is:\nChoose Edit\n> Preferences (Windows) or Acrobat /\nAdobe Acrobat Reader\n> Preferences (\nMac OS\n).\nThereafter, from the Categories on the left, select Updater.\nMethod 2:  Uninstall and Reinstall Adobe Acrobat\nIf updating doesn't work, you can try manually uninstalling and then reinstalling Adobe Acrobat. To uninstall the program, open the Control Panel from the Windows System folder in the Start Menu. Click on Programs, then click Uninstall a program. Find Adobe Acrobat, right-click on it, and select Uninstall. To reinstall, go to the Adobe website, download the version of Adobe Acrobat that you need, and install it according to the instructions.\nMethod 3: Repair Acrobat Installation\nIn cases where the installation has been corrupted but there are no new updates that you need to download, there is an option to just repair the installation instead of having to repeat the entire installation process.\nFirst, you need to open Adobe Acrobat and before it crashes again, click on Help in the menu and select Repair Acrobat Installation.\nThe program will give you simple instructions and you just have to follow them. When done, restart your computer and hopefully, the problem will have been fixed.\nMethod 4: Turn off the Protected View\nWhile Acrobat is open, click on Edit on the main menu and go to Preferences. From the Categories to the left side, choose Security (Enhanced). You will see the Sandbox Protections panel. Choose Off in the options for Protected View. Click \"No Security\" to close the box and restart Adobe Acrobat.\nMethod 5: Restart Your Computer\nMany software problems that are rooted in memory glitches have been solved with a simple restarting of the computer, and this might be all you need to do to stop the problem if Adobe Acrobat DC keeps crashing. During a restart, the RAM refreshes, so glitches and memory leaks that are causing software disruptions will go away.\nMethod 6: Update Your Graphics Driver\nIn rendering PDFs, Adobe Acrobat relies heavily on graphics processing. If your graphics drivers are outdated or no longer compatible with the software, it can result in crashes and other problems.\nTo update your graphics driver, click the Windows key on your keyboard + X then open the device manager. Click on the top node, then select Display Adaptors. Right-click on the graphics card. Follow the instructions that will appear. When done, restart your computer and try to open Adobe Acrobat again.\nMethod 7: Delete Corrupted or Interfering Plug-ins\nPlug-ins, like software updates, can sometimes cause malfunctions in the normal operation of Adobe Acrobat or other programs. If you had recently installed third-party plug-ins shortly before the crashes began, it might be helpful to get rid of these plug-ins as they might be causing the problem.\nTo do this, you first need to open File Explorer, click View on the menu, then click on the box for Hidden items. This will make the plugins folder visible. Find the Adobe Acrobat folder, then locate the plugins folder, and finally delete all the third-party plug-ins that you have recently installed.\nMethod 8: Clear Application Cache\nWhen cache builds up, it can sometimes cause Adobe Acrobat to crash. By clearing the cache, you can have a blank slate for the software, allowing it to run smoothly. To do this, you have to open File Explorer and go to this directory: C:\\Users\\[UserName]\\AppData\\Local\\Adobe\\Acrobat\\DC\\Cache\nSelect all the files that are in this folder (usually there is just one), right-click on them, and select Delete. When done, restart your computer and open Adobe Acrobat again.\nMethod 9: Use A Different PDF Software\nIf you have tried all the proposed solutions above but none of them seem to work, don’t fret. You might not be able to use Acrobat, at least for now, but there are many other PDF software out there that you can use as an alternative option. Some of these other programs offer bigger and better features, and many are also much more affordable. Here I strongly recommend you to try PDF Agile.\nPDF Agile offers you a quality, affordable, and complete solution. As its name suggests, PDF Agile is flexible and fast, and its tools are easy to use. Efficient PDF editing is just a mouse click away.\nFinal Thoughts\nAdobe Acrobat crashes can quickly become exasperating, especially if they happen intermittently. With the many PDF software alternatives now available, you can just switch to another program and maybe even find one that is better, cheaper, and easier to use. However, if you are adamant about staying with Acrobat, you can simply explore the possible solutions we have listed above until you find the one that works.\nIn any case, the first step is to find the answer to the question, why does Adobe Acrobat keep crashing? After doing some troubleshooting and finding the root of the problem, you can proceed to try viable solutions. You may have to patiently go through all the methods, from updating your software or clearing the cache to repeating the entire installation process. If you do end up having to find a different PDF application so you can get your work done in time, make sure to compare the choices carefully so that you can find the best for your requirements.\nKnowledge\nTroubleshoot\nAccelerate your PDF workflow like never before\nLearn more\nPopular now\nBest Free PDF Readers in 2026: Read, Annotate, and Manage PDFs with Ease\nWatermark PDFs with Ease: Online & Offline Methods\nHow to Edit PDF with LibreOffice\nPDF Agile Crack Alternative: Unlock Pro Features for Free\nShare this article\nLink copied!\nRelated Articles\nHow-to & Tips\n6 Mins\nAdobe Acrobat Not Opening?

I open the document, click on the Tools option from the upper bar, then click on the Edit PDF tool. A\nPerforming page recognition\npop up appears for about 2 seconds and then Adobe crashes. This was working fine last semester.\nSome (older) PDFs that I have opened do not crash when I attempt to edit the document.

You can select the tools from the right panel in Acrobat.\nCaution:\nIf you've performed the steps mentioned in Solution 1, and copied the files to the specified locations,\nthe new Acrobat versions might crash when you perform OCR on a scanned file. The issue occurs because Acrobat loads the older files copied earlier.\nTo resolve the crash, view\nAcrobat crashes while performing OCR on a scanned file\n.\nLike\nR\n1 person likes this\nReply\nM\nMM25537355yjv7\nCorrect answer\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nSeptember 23, 2023\nI just got this issue but the ones below didnt work.

As described the application is crashing while opening the scanned documents for editing.\nAs mentioned it is crashing with some and not all the PDFs would you mind sharing a sample PDF file with us for testing so that we can check it at our end.\nPlease try to repair the installation (For Windows only) and see if that works for you. Go to Help > Repair Installation.\nAlso, please try to disable the protected mode for testing. Go to Edit > Preferences > Enhanced Security >Turn off the Protected Mode and uncheck the enhanced Security > Click OK and reboot the application and check.\nNote: Please turn on the security after testing.\nYou may also take a look at the steps provided in the help page\nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/in/acrobat/kb/acrobat-dc-crashes-on-windows-os.html\nand see if that helps\nLet us know how it goes\nRegards\nAmal\n3 replies\nLike\nReply\nG\nGleeful_kid50BB\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|5 years ago\nNovember 25, 2020\nI had the exact same problem. Running Windows 10, Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 2015 Version 2015.006.30172.\nOddly, after lots of experimenting I discovered that the problem only occured on documents I scanned on my HP OfficeJet. (NOT from PDFs generated from applications such as Word, InDesign, IE or Chrome,etc which may use PDFWriter, Adobe Distiller, etc.). I discovered that \"Show bounding boxes\" was selected when the EDIT PDF tool page came up before Acrobat crashed.\nI opened a PDF that  was generated in Word, opened The EDIT PDF tool and\ndeselected\n\"Show bounding box\".\nAfter closing this file I opened up the problem PDF (generated by scanning a page on my HP OfficeJet Scanner. and had no problem going to the EDIT PDF tool. So now I could crop the page as I intended.\nI hope this helps you and everyone else with this issue.\n2 replies\nLike\nReply\nK\nKatie22452829u8jy\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|4 years ago\nDecember 30, 2021\nI'm having the exact same issue, but when I unlock the bounding box on a word file that's been converted to a PDF, close it, and reopen the problem PDF from my scanned document (also from my HP), I still can't edit it. I also can't uncheck the bound box as that requires editing the PDF, which causes the program to close. Any advice? It's maddening!\nLike\nReply\nShow 1 more reply\nShow 2 more replies\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nTo post, reply, or follow discussions, please sign in with your Adobe ID.\nSign in\nSign in to Adobe Community\nTo post, reply, or follow discussions, please sign in with your Adobe ID.\nSign in\nEnter your E-mail address.

Acrobat's preferences setting, so we'll be checking with other possible solutions here.\n1- You may reboot your computer first.\n2- Use this cleaner tool and remove Acrobat and its traces:\nhttps://labs.adobe.com/downloads/acrobatcleaner.html?22\n3- Once done, download the application again.\nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/acrobat-dc-downloads.html\n4- If it still doesn't work, then try the further troubleshooting steps suggested here:\nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/global/troubleshoot-system-errors-freezes-mac.html\nThanks,\nAkanchha\nLike\nReply\nPowered by

Could you confirm the application you are facing issue with - Acrobat XI or Acrobat DC?\nAlso try following troubleshooting steps:\n1- Try installing the latest update for Acrobat from this link:\nAdobe - Acrobat : For Windows\nreboot the machine after installing update and try again.\n2- Launch Acrobat as an administrator-\nRun an Adobe program as administrator | Windows 7, Vista\n3- Try running Acrobat in compatibility mode ( if using Windows 10) by locating Acrobat icon on the desktop > right click > properties > compatibility tab > check the box run this program in compatibility mode for and select Windows 7 from the drop-down options. click Apply OK and check.\nIs there any error message you are getting when Acrobat crashes? Does this happen with you open any pdf file in Acrobat or when launching the application?\nAlso, let us know the operating system installed on the machine?\nLet us know if you need any help.\nShivam\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nA\nAnonymous\nForum|Forum|6 years ago\nOctober 11, 2019\nHi, Im having the same issue but with Adobe Acrobat DC.

After \"Adobe\" I see \"Acrobat\" which will lead me to \"PDFMaker\". I have \"Adobe Acrobat\" as an option that will give me \"DC\" but after I click on \"DC\" I have no \"Privileged\" option under that selection. I have tried Uninstalling and reinstalling 4 times in a span of 24hrs. It installs, but when I try to open it, it doesn't open.

I would expect cropped out areas to be deleted.\nI believe prior versions of Acrobat DC used to crop pages cleanly and delete the cropped areas.\nHow do I fix this? If I try to delete the boxes, it is time consuming and destroys the integrity of the document.\nEdit and convert PDFs\nLike\nReply\nSubscribe\nThis topic has been closed for replies.\nLuke Jennings\nInspiring\nForum|Forum|8 years ago\nDecember 29, 2017\nAn alternate method is to set up 8 pages in InDesign as 4 page spreads, then place the 2 gatefold PDF pages and export to 8 single page PDFs. You can then re-order the pages in Acrobat.\nIf the gatefold PDF pages are not all the same size (contains short pages for folding), you can adjust individual page sizes in InDesign using the page tool, or slightly enlarge the placed PDF to fit the desired final size.\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nF\nfiedler\nAuthor\nKnown Participant\nForum|Forum|8 years ago\nDecember 29, 2017\nLuke, that is what I did. It was faster to copy the pages from the gatefold to a new InDesign document with single-pages and then export as a pdf.\nBernd, I will try your method too.\nLike\nReply\nBernd Alheit\nCommunity Expert\nForum|Forum|8 years ago\nDecember 28, 2017\nfiedler\nwrote\n...\nI believe prior versions of Acrobat DC used to crop pages cleanly and delete the cropped areas.\n...\nNo. Acrobat DC works like the previous versions.\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nF\nfiedler\nAuthor\nKnown Participant\nForum|Forum|8 years ago\nDecember 28, 2017\nYou are correct. I opened some old documents and found they also contain artifacts.\nYou can reduce file size be removing these artifacts from the indivudual pages by editing in Acro DC.\nDo this before organizing/assembling the pages, otherwise it will be torture.\nIf you open the pdf in Illustrator, you see that Acrobat DC does not really crop the pages, it merely hides what you cropped out.\nOK if you want to preserve future editing capabilities, but for document distribution and more compact files, it's better to have the uneeded parts gone.\nThere should be an option to permenently delete what has been cropped.\n3 replies\nLike\nReply\nBernd Alheit\nCommunity Expert\nForum|Forum|8 years ago\nDecember 28, 2017\nYou can remove this with the Preflight tool.\nLike\nReply\nShow 2 more replies\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nTo post, reply, or follow discussions, please sign in with your Adobe ID.\nSign in\nSign in to Adobe Community\nTo post, reply, or follow discussions, please sign in with your Adobe ID.\nSign in\nEnter your E-mail address.

When I signed the first signature, Acrobat DC verified the signature correctly, but when I added the second signature (even though the second signature was signed with Acrobat DC) , Acrobat DC will report that the previous signature is invalid, but I didn’t actually make any changes. Other PDF software (Acrobat 9.0 Pro/iText/Foxit) can verify these signatures correctly. I don't understand what causes the Acrobat DC verification to fail?\nIn addition, I also encountered a \"1 miscellaneous change(s)\" problem in Case1.pdf\nUse the latest Windows 10 and Acrobat Pro DC

Adobe added however that it was not aware of any abuse of the bugs in the wild.\nThe free Acrobat Reader 2020 and PDF-creation and editing software Acrobat 2020 were among the list of those programs with critical bugs patched. Adobe also patched Acrobat DC, Acrobat DC Reader, Acrobat Reader 2017 and Acrobat 2017. In all, Adobe patched 20 Acrobat bugs, with nine rated important.\nTwo of the most serious Acrobat vulnerabilities are use-after-free flaws (\nCVE-2021-28641, CVE-2021-28639\n) that, in a worst case scenario, allow an adversary to execute code arbitrarily on targeted systems or just create application crashes.\nOne of the more interesting critical bugs patched is a type of vulnerability called an “uncontrolled search path element” flaw (CVE-2021-28636). The vulnerability class also goes by the names DLL preloading, insecure library loading and dependency confusion. It’s unclear how the weakness was introduced to Adobe Acrobat. The security bulletin links to a generic description of the flaw which states:\n“The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors… In some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used,” according to a\nMITRE description of the vulnerability\ntype.\nAdobe Illustrator and Bridge, Also Patched\nAdditional Adobe products were also part of the vendor’s roundup of fixes, Bridge, Framemaker Dimension and Illustrator.\nFour\ncritical bugs\nin Adobe’s Bridge, a free app for managing digital assets, were patched. These include a heap-based buffer-overflow flaw (CVE-2021-28624), improper input-validation vulnerability (CVE-2021-35991) and two arbitrary code-execution bugs (CVE-2021-35989, CVE-2021-35990).\nA heap-based buffer overflow allows for arbitrary code execution by an adversary causing either a program crash, infinite loop restart of a program or a type of denial-of-service attack based on CPU or memory overconsumption. Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative researcher Tran Van Khang is credited for identifying the bug.\nOne critical flaw (\nCVE-2021-28596\n) was reported, and patched, in Adobe’s Windows version of its high-end document processing software FrameMaker. This arbitrary code-execution bug is classified as an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, meaning an adversary could create an exploit that target’s a systems memory, where the malicious software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended memory buffer. This can either corrupt data, or crash a targeted system or allow a hacker to execute code on the targeted system.\nCheck out our free\nupcoming live and on-demand webinar events\n– unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\nSuggested articles\nRansomware Attacks are on the Rise\nLockbit is by far this summer’s most prolific ransomware group, trailed by two offshoots of the Conti group.\nCybercriminals Are Selling Access to Chinese Surveillance Cameras\nTens of thousands of cameras have failed to patch a critical, 11-month-old CVE, leaving thousands of organizations exposed.\nFirewall Bug Under Active Attack Triggers CISA Warning\nCISA is warning that Palo Alto Networks’ PAN-OS is under active attack and needs to be patched ASAP.\nInfoSec Insider\nSecuring Your Move to the Hybrid Cloud\nWhy Physical Security Maintenance Should Never Be an Afterthought\nConti’s Reign of Chaos: Costa Rica in the Crosshairs\nHow War Impacts Cyber Insurance\nRethinking Vulnerability Management in a Heightened Threat Landscape\nThreatpost\nTopics\nCloud Security\nMalware\nVulnerabilities\nPrivacy\nShow all\nBlack Hat\nCritical Infrastructure\nCryptography\nFacebook\nFeatured\nGovernment\nHacks\nIoT\nMobile Security\nPodcasts\nRSAC\nSecurity Analyst Summit\nSlideshow\nVideos\nWeb Security\nAuthors\nElizabeth Montalbano\nNate Nelson\nThreatpost\nHome\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nRSS Feeds\nInfoSec Insider\nInfosec Insider Post\nInfosec Insider content is written by a trusted community of Threatpost cybersecurity subject matter experts.

unstable, unreliable and full of bugs. Today, when opening up the program I was notified that my trial for DC had ended - HOWEVER, I am not on a trial, I am on year #4 of my paid subscription!! Now, features I had are gone, the Prepare Form function no longer works, I cannot create fillable PDFs (a service I get paid to do!)\nHow can I justify paying every month for something that does not

Discover the ultimate guide to diagnose and fix the issue quickly and effectively!\nLink copied!\nFor many years, Adobe Acrobat has been the ultimate tool for viewing, creating, and editing PDF documents. It has set the gold standards and, in the majority’s opinion, few other software have come close. Nevertheless, Adobe Acrobat is still not perfect and can be susceptible to issues. One problem that quite a few users have run across is the dreaded error: Adobe Acrobat not responding.\nSeeing these kinds of error messages can be very frustrating but if ever this happens to you, don’t panic. There are many ways to fix it, and we are going to discuss those methods today.\nUnderstanding Why Adobe Acrobat Might Not Be Responding\nBefore we delve into the possible solutions, it is important to trace the root of the problem first. So, we have to answer the question, why is it not responding, or why is Adobe Acrobat DC not responding? Well, here are some of the most common reasons.\nThe Adobe Acrobat Version Is Outdated\nOne of the reasons why software developers release new versions is to fix bugs that have been discovered in the older versions. If you miss an update and continue using the version that you have had for years, chances are that you will encounter problems that have already been solved.\nThe Operating System Does Not Support Adobe Acrobat\nAdobe Acrobat is compatible with most Windows and MacOS versions that are in use these days. However, it sometimes happens that new OS updates cause non-responsiveness in some software, and Adobe Acrobat may be one of them. Then again, failure to update an old operating system to a newer version might also trigger the “Adobe Acrobat not responding” issue.\nThere Are Conflicts With Other Digital Components\nSome software, plug-ins, or other digital tools might modify how the operating system or other applications interact with each other. Oftentimes, such changes are perfectly harmless and only serve to enhance the particular software’s performance. However, there are also cases when the presence of such components causes conflicts that keep Adobe Acrobat from functioning properly.\nSystem Resources are Not Enough to Run the Software\nLike any other software, Adobe Acrobat needs a certain amount of system resources in order to function smoothly. The requirements are not excessive but if most of your system resources are already in use by other programs, then you might have to face the problem of Adobe Acrobat, or Adobe Acrobat DC, or even Adobe Acrobat Pro not responding.\nA Corruption Occurs In The Program Installation\nIt is possible that Adobe Acrobat would be working properly for a while after you install it but after some time, it would often freeze and just stop responding. A reason could be a corrupted installation, like if updates are not installed completely, or if you experience a system failure while you are running the program.\nThe Installation Files Themselves Are Corrupted\nInstallation files are vital to a proper and complete Adobe Acrobat setup. If these files are corrupted or have been tampered with, the installation will not be completed. Corruption can happen due to hardware failure while installing or if the installation process is disrupted for any reason.\nProtected Mode is Enabled in Adobe Settings\nWhile there are certainly some benefits to being in protected mode, it can also get in the way of the smooth operation of the software. In this mode, certain functionalities are restricted to protect your system from malicious files. The downside is that this can result in it not responding at all.\nEffective Methods for Fixing the Issue\nSo now you have an idea of the possible reasons why Adobe Acrobat would freeze or not respond. The next step is to take the corresponding action to fix the problem. Here are some tried and tested methods.\nMethod 1: Restart Adobe Acrobat and Reboot Your Computer\nThe most often-used remedy for these issues is the good old restart. Sometimes, all it takes is to close the program and open it again, and it will be working fine. You can also try shutting down your computer and booting it up again. This will essentially refresh the system, free up resources, and apply updates that are pending.\nSince the program is already not responding at this point, it's likely that you won't be able to close it normally. In this case, you would have to force close it. On Windows, you would have to open Task Manager, select Adobe Acrobat in the list of programs, then click on End Task. On a Mac computer, you must open Force Quit Applications by pressing Option+Command+Esc, select Adobe Acrobat, and click on Force Quit. Then, you can reboot your computer.\nMethod 2: Reinstall Adobe Acrobat\nIn case there has been some corruption in the installation, or if some of the files have been damaged, reinstalling the program will take care of it. In addition, you will also be able to get new updates to the software, if there are any. To apply this method, you first need to uninstall Acrobat. If you are on Mac, open Finder, go to Applications, and look for Adobe Acrobat. To delete the file, right-click on it and choose \"Move to Trash.\" Remember to empty the trash afterward to permanently remove the file from your device.\nMethod 3: Install Adobe Reader First\nFor Windows users, the order of installing Adobe software is sometimes crucial. First, uninstall the existing Adobe Acrobat on your computer. Then go to the Adobe website, download Adobe Reader, and install it according to the instructions. When this is done, that is the time to reinstall the Adobe Acrobat Pro or DC.\nIn many cases, this should solve the Adobe Acrobat not responding issue. The reason is that installing Adobe Reader first can set a stable foundation, which reduces the risk of compatibility issues when you bring back the more complex Acrobat files.\nMethod 4: Close Other Programs That Are Currently Running\nOther programs running in the background are using up system resources, keeping Adobe Acrobat from running successfully. Close all programs that you don't need at the moment to free up resources, which could enable Acrobat to run properly. Go to Task Manager and take a look at all the running applications in the list, then right-click on the unimportant ones and click on End Task to close them.\nMethod 5: Update Your Adobe Acrobat Software\nAuto-updates are ordinarily turned on by default. However, if your Adobe Acrobat does not automatically get updates for whatever reason, you should check if they are available and download the updates manually. You can do this easily by following these steps:\nClick on Help on the Adobe Acrobat main menu, then click on Check for Updates.\nIf an update is available, the program will let you know. Click the Download and Install link and wait for the download to finish.\nUpon completing the download, close Adobe Acrobat and open the new .exe file you have just downloaded. This will install an updated version of the software.\nOpen the updated software and see if it works properly.\nMethod 6: Run the Program as Administrator\nIf updating the software doesn’t work, it could be because you don’t have complete rights to the software. What you can do in this case is to go to the folder that contains your Adobe Acrobat files. Look for the .exe file, right-click on it, and choose Run as administrator. If you are asked to accept User Account Control, just accept it and see if the software would run properly.\nMethod 7: Run the Program in Compatibility Mode\nTo test whether the Adobe Acrobat version you have is compatible with your current operating system, you can run it in compatibility mode. Here’s how to do it.\nFind the Adobe Acrobat shortcut or the .exe file.\nRight-click on it and choose Properties. A popup window will appear.\nFind the Compatibility mode and tick the box that says “Run this program in compatibility mode”. From the drop-down menu, choose the operating system that you have.\nAlso, tick the box that says \"Run this program as an administrator.\nMethod 8: Do Not Enable Protected Mode\nAdobe Acrobat has a protected mode to keep documents safe from unauthorized access and other dangers. However, enabling this tightens restrictions around the files, which also sometimes causes erratic behavior in the program, like not responding at times.\nYou can disable the protected mode by clicking Edit on the main menu, then go to Preferences. Look for Enable Protected Mode at Startup and make sure the box for it is unchecked. Take note that disabling protected mode can put you at risk as it eliminates some layers of protection, so you should use it sparingly and with the utmost prudence.\nMethod 9: Try Using a Different PDF Software\nMuch as you might want to stay with familiar software, sometimes the Adobe Acrobat not responding problem just won’t go away. It’s not so bad to try alternatives, especially if you need to work on your PDF files right away. There are plenty of really good options out there, like PDF Agile, which are more affordable and might work out better in the long run. Here I strongly recommend you to try PDF Agile.\nPDF Agile offers you a quality, affordable, and complete solution. As its name suggests, PDF Agile is flexible and fast, and its tools are easy to use. Efficient PDF editing is just a mouse click away.\nFinal Thoughts\nIt can be immensely stressful and inconvenient when you find yourself face to face with Adobe Acrobat not responding to error messages, especially when you are in a rush to work on your PDF files. However, by understanding the possible cause and by taking the right steps, you can quickly overcome the issue.\nSometimes the solution is as simple as restarting the program, while other cases might require slightly more techie ways like reinstalling the program or running it as an administrator. Nevertheless, don't worry because there will always be an available solution. If worse comes to worst, you can always switch to an alternative PDF software, at least in the meantime. The important thing is to consider all the options and pick the one that would work best for the situation.\nTroubleshoot\nAccelerate your PDF workflow like never before\nLearn more\nPopular now\nHow to Edit PDF with LibreOffice\nHow to Properly Cite Photos and Images in PowerPoint?\nHow to Add Captions in PowerPoint for Accessible Presentations？\nHow to Change Slide Size in PowerPoint Easily?\nShare this article\nLink copied!\nRelated Articles\nHow-to & Tips\n6 Mins\nAdobe Acrobat Not Opening?

Thank you. Reading through all the solutions, some work partially, until the next upgrade in two days.\n@Adobe, Please create a toned down or minimalistic version of Acrobat DC that does not have to load all the bells, whistles, and errors with the software. It is almost worthwhile not having a subscription and just running Acrobat Reader, or changing to something entirely different.\nAll the stuff you are building into your applications is remarkable, and sporadically, I love playing on all the bells and whistles. However, some people just need a basic system to send proofs and documents to clients and back, without having to upload everything to Adobe Cloud, or having to continuously switch it off, running AI or all the other functions. I definitely don't want my confidential work on Adobe cloud hanging about.\nIf nothing else, at least include an option to run it in Sandbox mode with none of the optional tools included, apart from the ones you want to include in your application, where no constant internet connection is required.\nFurthermore, not everybody has superfast internet or has superfast computers and laptops with all the latest specs and memory digits and graphic cards attached to it. Running at 16G memory and a memory card, and Adobe's connectivity requirements, still slows everything down. The memory is not the issue here, the connectivity is in an urban area.\nThe constant need for connectivity from Adobe applications makes the workflow slow, sluggish and frustrating, and exceptionally heavy on system resources. Verify licenses and release your grip on system resources so that work can get done, instead of watching adobe icons spinning into oblivion endlessly for 5 to 10 minutes, every time you need to create a PDF to send out on email.\nBring Freehand MX back, and charge less if you need to, and a simple basic Acrobat Reader with some minor editing and form filling tools, without all the other baggage.\nLike\nReply\nA\nAdam231076108q7d\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nFebruary 28, 2024\nI'm still having the exact same issue even when turning off protected mode... memory usages are fine until I open up certain PDF drawings.\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nManuel De Jesus\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nMarch 4, 2024\nGo to Security (enhanced) unchecked Enable protectected mode at startup then go to folder at c:\\program files\\Adobe\\Acrobat DC\\Acrobat.  Then right click acrobat then click compatibility then click change settings for all users.  Select compatibility mode windows 8 and click Run this program as administrator click apply then ok.  Now it should be fast.\nLike\n1 person likes this\nReply\nB\nBen348629319t6p\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nJanuary 17, 2024\nGood to see it's not just me.

Open Acrobat then open the file, however the files would eventually lock up & crash...\nI recently upgraded Acrobat to 64 bit which made the problem worse, such that I couldn't open any PDF files at all.\nBy running the Windows Task Manager I found that Acrobat was running as a background process, force stopping it and restarting did not fix the issue...\nI de-installed Acrobat and used the AcroCleaner tool for both DC2015 Pro & Reader & DC2022.\nI then reinstalled Acrobat, via Adobe Creative Cloud, which automatically installed DC Pro 64 Bit.\nAnd hey presto,\nI still could not open any PDFs\n.\nAfter searching Dr Google I found this...\nUsing Fix No.4 which entails disabling Protected Mode via the Registry my problem is solved, I can now open all PDFs seamlessly...\n______________________________\nhttps://www.makeuseof.com/windows-adobe-acrobat-reader-not-opening-pdf/\nThe following is an excerpt from the above website...\nProtected Mode is a security feature introduced in Reader 10.0 that protects users from viruses and attacks. This is a good thing for your security, but it sometimes misinterprets files as malicious and doesn't open them correctly.  (\nSometimes?!)\nAs such, you can try temporarily turning off this mode to see if it's preventing the software from opening PDFs. Here's how to do it:\nPress Win + R to open the Run command.\nType Regedit and tap Enter to open Registry Editor.\nPaste the following address into the Registry Editor.\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Adobe\\Adobe Acrobat\\DC\\FeatureLockDown\nRight-click and navigate to New > DWORD Value.\nRename the file to \"bProtectedMode.\"\nRight-click the file and tap on Modify.\nChange data value to 0 to disable Protected Mode.\nRun the PDF file again with Protected Mode off. Keep Protected Mode off if everything works well this time instead of having to turn it on/off many times throughout the day. Of course, this will compromise your security, so it's up to you to decide if it's worth keeping off!\n______________________________\nThankyou Adobe for running protected mode in the background and not telling your customers.\nAnd I would like to undertand Mr Adobe, what is the purpose of this \"Protected Mode\", and who exactly is it you are protecting, your cloud??  I run both Virus & Malware Protection on all my machines.  So what is the purpose of you locking my PC down?\nYou are in breach of my Privacy!!\nPlease also note Mr Adobe you have wasted 5 days of my time this month while I have dealt with your under performing \"Product\".  And I now must set up all my settings (again).  Are you going to compensate me for this time??\nAnd Mr Adobe, don't you dare modify the registry on my PC and blow my registry settings away the next time you deliver me and \"upgrade\"...\nCan I come along and adjust the registry in your machines?  I seriously doubt it...\nCreate PDFs\nCrash or freeze\nGeneral troubleshooting\nEdit and convert PDFs\nLike\nD\n9 people like this\nReply\nSubscribe\nCorrect answer\nEno9\nI just run into the same problem, and after trying different proposed solution, the one below worked for me:\n\"Close the Acrobat application and try to recreate application preferences once.\nOpen Windows search bar -> type regedit and open registry editor\nOpen Hkey current user->software->Adobe-> Delete the following keys (folders): Adobe Acrobat, Acrobat Arm, Acrobat Distiller, PDF settings & common file.\"\nR\nRosemary35307861luc9\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nFebruary 13, 2025\nThis is absolutely ridiculous. This problem has been going on since at least 2017. That is 8 YEARS! Why has this problem not been corrected? I have to repeatedly uninstall and reinstall software that I am PAYING for. I guess since there isn't really a replacement for this software, Adobe doesn't feel the need to provide a quality product. Unbelievable!\nLike\nReply\nG\nGiddy_yogi7734\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nDecember 8, 2024\nLegend! Thanks!

I encounter more problems after I could finaly get Adobe to open. I get a white rectangle shapped box with the spinning blue \"circle of death\" image from Win 10 in the center of the white box. It never will open a pdf file or do anything further, for that matter. This Adobe Reader version is a joke. It won't work on my Dell desktop. I've given up. Tried uninstalling, reinstalling it, repair options.....nothing has worked. Microsoft Edge browser isn't good as defualt if you need to do much with the pdf. There are few if any features to it, another joke. Moved on to something else. Something else that works, doesn't hand and does what I need it to do.\nLike\nReply\nShow more replies\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nTo post, reply, or follow discussions, please sign in with your Adobe ID.\nSign in\nSign in to Adobe Community\nTo post, reply, or follow discussions, please sign in with your Adobe ID.\nSign in\nEnter your E-mail address.

One is similar to previously reported - I cannot maximise or even resize in any direction the Acrobat Pro DC window. Run in AppContainer is\nnot\nticked. The real problem however is that I can no longer save files after editing them. Either Acrobat hangs and has to be shut down by Task Manager, or more commonly the Save As window is blank and doesnt respond.\n•\nAttachment\n[protected]\n:\nDisplayFusionDebugInfo.zip [1,002,731 bytes]\nDec 8, 2021\n•\n#1\nHi Matthew,\nDo these issues persist if you exit DisplayFusion?\nThanks!\nDec 9, 2021\n•\n#2\nMatthew Barnard\n8 discussion posts\nTHanks I will check. I had not realised I could \"exit\". Assumed I had to uninstall which I was reluctant to do, as it is so useful in every other way.\nDec 11, 2021\n•\n#3\nMatthew Barnard\n8 discussion posts\nOk so exited DF and now the Acrobat DC (the pro not the reader) maximises and resizes. So it does not persist when I exit.\nDec 11, 2021\n•\n#4\nthe good doctor\n46 discussion posts\nI can confirm the problem as well.\nThe problem is only for Adobe Acrobat Reader 64bit -  the problem is that the window's maximize button (and title bar context menu entry to maximize) does not function at all with DF running (tried the latest beta with no change)\nProblem is not apparent with the 32bit version.\nThe 'Maximize' DF custom titlebar button does work.\nDec 13, 2021\n•\n#5\nthe good doctor\n46 discussion posts\ndisabling the application hooks allows the maximize button to work\nDec 13, 2021\n•\n#6\nMatthew Barnard\n8 discussion posts\nThank you doctor. This worked.\n\"The 'Maximize' DF custom titlebar button does work\"\nI do not really use advanced features of DF - mainly just use it for dividing an ultra wide screen. I was not aware that I could maximise via the titlebar button. This works perfectly now - many thanks.\nWhat do you mean by application hooks?\nDec 13, 2021\n(modified\nDec 13, 2021\n)\n•\n#7\nthe good doctor\n46 discussion posts\nUnder the 'compatibility settings' (DF settings, see compatibility tab on the left) one can tweak certain aspects of DF for non-compliant programs.\nHopefully the programmers will address this compatibility problem.\nI think this all goes back to this unique window type (a known problem maker) under 64bits.\nDec 13, 2021\n(modified\nDec 13, 2021\n)\n•\n#8\nMatthew Barnard\n8 discussion posts\nInterestingly disabling the application hooks means that  maximise goes to the whole screen (ignoring the monitor split in DF), but using both of your workarounds enables me to resize or maximise as preferred.\nSo thank you very much once again.\nDec 13, 2021\n•\n#9\nWhat version of Adobe Acrobat are you running?\nThanks!\nDec 16, 2021\n•\n#10\nMatthew Barnard\n8 discussion posts\nAcrobat Pro DC (version 2021.007.20099) 32 Bit version\nDec 16, 2021\n(modified\nDec 17, 2021\n)\n•\n#11\nThanks for sending that over, we we're able to reproduce the issue on our end, so I've added it to our list to look into.

This has been a problem for me with Acrobat Pro not Reader and it has been the 32 bit version.

This might be because Im now on Windows 11, whereas I was using Windows 10 when speaking about that fix.\nI can attach a video if it would help, but when I launch Acrobat DC with DisplayFusion running, it'll open in a window and I can move it around.  As soon as I maximize the program to a split, the program freezes.  I cant minimize, I cant click on any menus...nothing.  After maybe 20-30 seconds, it'll unfreeze.  I'll move to another split, and itll happen all over again.  As soon as I close DisplayFusion, Acrobat will work without issue.\nBasically I cant run Acrobat DC while DisplayFusion is open.\nPlease let me know what info I can provide to try and help fix this issue.\nThanks\nUpdate: attached video to explain exactly what is going on.\nI should have included in the video that in Preferences -> Security (Enhanced), Enable protected mode at startup is unchecked and Run in AppContainer is greyed out.\nAlso, Acrobat Reader works just fine with the protect mode/run in appcontainer settings unchecked.  This seems to be an issue with Acrobat Pro DC.  Hope someone can point me to some settings I may not be aware of to fix this.

If a monitor is split (via DisplayFusion), Acrobat maximizes outside of screen.  Window controls are then outside of screen and I need to close the program.\nEdit:  I should add that I had edited the Compatibility properties for Acrobat (right click / properties / Compatibility / Change high DPI settings / Override high DPI scaling behavior) so that Acrobat would not freeze when maximizing window (with DisplayFusion installed).\nApr 18, 2023\n(modified\nApr 18, 2023\n)\n•\n#22\nI can't seem to find that adobe compatibility setting, could you send me over a screenshot of it?\nApr 19, 2023\n•\n#23\nRodrigo Izurieta\n2 discussion posts\nSure.

My reader completely freezes up for a while when I lock it to one of my \"screens\" that are partitioned on my ultrawide with DF. I am running Win 11 latest build, DF latest build, Adobe Acrobat Reader 64-bit (Continuous release, current version 2023.001.20174).\nProblem goes away when DF is closed. It gets messed up anytime I move it to a new DF window (1.1, 1.2, or 1.3) and it locks into that window. The app almost crashed and then eventually starts working again. When I hold shift to maximize to full screen, it works fine, seems to be entirely related to the \"Window Position Profiles\".\nMay 18, 2023\n•\n#26\nmrbeaubo\n4 discussion posts\nQuote:\nAh thanks for sending that over.

Weird issues, too, like comments will randomly stop working, or fonts will disappear from the page until they close and re-open.\nSometimes logging out and getting on a different machine works, sometimes it doesn't. The problems do not always follow, but they do seem to happen to a particular small group of users. I cannot narrow down any particular actions they are doing, besides one user that routinely has 5-10 individual PDFs open to try and reference back and forth.\nMoving away from Acrobat is not an available option because they use an addon that, when I asked about an API with a competing PDF program, said that the addon developer was their client and they wouldn't allow me access to the API to create a \"competing product.\"\nEnvironment is Azure VD, everyone has their own individual VM (I know, I'm working on it) with 2 vCPU, 8G RAM.\nAnyone have any wizardry that might be Acrobat more stable for them?\nRead more\nShare\nReddit Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nUser Agreement\nYour Privacy Choices\nAccessibility\nReddit, Inc. © 2026.

and\nHTG\n. Having used Windows for over a decade, he's accumulated plenty of experience with the OS. He's been writing on a variety of Windows topics for over five years, incorporating his expertise to teach readers how to get the most out of their Windows devices and resolve issues with the operating system.\nHe has been writing professionally since 2016. He joined MUO in 2021, and his work has been viewed over 20 million times since then. Outside of writing, he spends his time exploring the cryptocurrency market and gaining insights into general trading.\nSign in to your\nMUO\naccount\nFor the majority of Windows users, Adobe Acrobat is the go-to PDF viewer. It's easy to use, a great tool for creating PDFs, and you can edit, print, and allow others to access your collection.\nThe software, however, sometimes acts up like any other app, so you may experience a variety of problems while using it. A common issue is when Adobe Acrobat Reader DC won't open PDF files. As such, here are 12 fixes you can try to fix Adobe Acrobat Reader DC not being able to open PDF files.\nBefore We Get Started...\nBefore implementing any of the fixes, make sure the problem isn't occurring only with one PDF. Check any other file in the software. If all other files work fine, redownload the PDF or recall it from the source you got it from earlier.\nWhen you are unable to open any of the PDF files, you can proceed to the below fixes.\n1. Close Background Processes and Give Adobe a Fresh Start\nMany processes continue to run in the background even after we close the program. It means that closing and reopening Adobe Acrobat without closing these processes won't count as a fresh start. Therefore, you must close all associated processes in the Task Manager before closing the main program and reopening it.\nFollow the below steps to do so:\nRight-click on the Windows\nStart\nbutton and select\nTask Manager\n.\nFind processes related to Adobe Acrobat.\nTo end the process, right-click on it and select\nEnd task\n.\nScreenshot by Shan Abdul\nClose all relevant tasks one by one, then close the main program. Once everything is closed, open the PDF again using Adobe Acrobat. If the issue is not resolved, start implementing the following fixes.\n2. Run Adobe Acrobat as an Administrator\nWhenever you\nrun an app as an administrator\n, it has full access to all files of your operating system that would otherwise be restricted. As such, the first fix you should try is to run Adobe Acrobat Reader as an administrator. If Windows is stopping Adobe from opening PDF files due to missing or corrupted permissions, running it as administrator will fix the issue.\nYou can run Adobe Acrobat as an administrator by simply left-clicking on the icon and tapping\nRun as administrator.\nIf the software is working well now and opening PDFs normally, consider making this setting the default for Adobe Acrobat. Follow these steps to configure Adobe to run as an administrator by default:\nRight-click on the Adobe shortcut and go to\nProperties.\nNavigate to the\nShortcut tab\nin the Properties window.\nTap on\nAdvanced.\nCheck the box for\nRun as administrator\nand hit\nOK.\nNo Attribution Required\nGiving administrator privileges to programs that aren't backed by trusted sources can be dangerous. Always be careful of which programs you grant administrative rights to.\n3. Run Adobe Acrobat in Compatibility Mode\nWith the Windows compatibility mode, older versions of Windows can be used as operating systems. There might be some programs that work better with an older version of Windows than an updated one.\nIf you are using an Adobe version that is not compatible with the current version of Windows, run it in compatibility mode. To do so, follow these steps:\nRight-click on the Adobe Acrobat shortcut and go to\nProperties.\nNavigate to the\nCompatibility tab\nin the Properties window.\nCheck the box for\nCompatibility mode.\nChoose any older Windows version from the available options.\nTap on\nApply\nand hit\nOK.\nNo Attribution Required\nIf compatibility were the problem, Adobe would begin opening PDF as usual. If not, make sure you turn off compatibility mode before implementing the rest of the fixes on this list.\n4. Scan the PDF File for Malware\nAdobe Acrobat may not open the PDF you're trying to read if it detects any infection. The software does this to prevent your device from getting infected with viruses, which can wreak havoc on your computer.\nConsidering that, you should ensure that the PDFs that failed to open in Adobe Acrobat are virus-free. There are several ways to check that, but here is the simplest:\nGo to\nVirusTotal's website\n.\nGo to the\nFile\ntab, then click the\nChoose File\nbutton.\nScreenshot by Shan Abdul - NAR\nSelect the PDF file Adobe failed to open and follow the on-screen instructions to confirm uploading the file.\nWait for VirusTotal's virus scanner tool to finish processing.\nScreenshot by Shan Abdul - NAR\nIf the tool detects an infection in a file, you should delete it. Then, download a new copy of the same PDF, and Adobe Acrobat should open it without any problem.\nYou can also\nscan a file for viruses with Microsoft Defender\n, a built-in virus scanner on Windows.\n5. Disable Protected Mode\nProtected Mode is a security feature introduced in Reader 10.0 that protects users from viruses and attacks. This is a good thing for your security, but it sometimes misinterprets files as malicious and doesn't open them correctly.\nAs such, you can try temporarily turning off this mode to see if it's preventing the software from opening PDFs. Here's how to do it:\nPress\nWin + R\nto open the Run command.\nType\nRegedit\nand tap Enter to open Registry Editor.\nPaste the following address into the Registry Editor.\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Adobe\\Adobe Acrobat\\DC\\FeatureLockDown\nRight-click and navigate to\nNew > DWORD Value.\nScreenshot by Shan Abdul - NAR\nRename the file to\n\"bProtectedMode.\"\nRight-click the file and tap on\nModify.\nChange\ndata value\nto\n0\nto disable Protected Mode.\nScreenshot by Shan Abdul - NAR\nRun the PDF file again with Protected Mode off. Keep Protected Mode off if everything works well this time instead of having to turn it on/off many times throughout the day. Of course, this will compromise your security, so it's up to you to decide if it's worth keeping off!\n6. Compress the PDF File\nAdobe Acrobat sometimes crashes or fails to open large PDF files, for instance, a document with thousands of pages. If the software cannot open a large PDF file, compress it to reduce size. Taking this step will ensure that the file size is not the problem.\nTo compress a PDF file, follow these steps:\nOpen the Compress PDF tool by\nSmallpdf\n.\nClick\nChoose Files\nand select the file you wish to compress.\nScreenshot by Shan Abdul - NAR\nChoose the type of compression and click\nCompress\n.\nLet the tool complete the compression process.\nOnce done, download the compressed PDF file and open it using Adobe Acrobat to see if it opens successfully.\n7. Make Adobe Acrobat Your Default PDF Viewer\nDo you use an app other than Adobe Acrobat to open PDF files by default, and when you attempt to open them manually in Adobe Acrobat, the app fails to do so? If that's the case, try making Adobe Acrobat your default app for opening PDF files to see if it successfully opens them this way.\nYou can do that by following these steps:\nRight-click on any PDF file and select\nProperties\n.\nGo to the\nGeneral\ntab and click the\nChange...\nbutton.\nScreenshot by Shan Abdul - NAR\nSelect\nAdobe Acrobat\nfrom the list of apps and click\nSet default\n.\nScreenshot by Shan Andul - NAR\nClick\nApply\n, then\nOK\n.\n8. Repair and Update Adobe Acrobat Reader DC\nIn the presence of Potentially Unwanted Programs, some of the files of software and apps can get corrupted. Corrupted files cause Adobe Acrobat to malfunction. The common issues are improper file saving, crashing issues, and software not properly loading all PDFs.\nTo make sure this isn't an issue, repair Adobe Acrobat once. This will repair any corrupt files and reinstall any missing files. To repair Adobe Acrobat, follow these steps:\nOpen Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.\nNavigate to the\nHelp tab.\nTap on\nRepair Installation.\nScreenshot by Shan Abdul - NAR\nIf the problem persists after repairing the software, check for any available updates. An outdated version of Adobe Acrobat can also lead to such a problem.\nTo do that, open Adobe Acrobat and navigate to\nHelp > Check for Updates.\nAdobe will take some time to check for updates, and you can update to the latest version if it is available.\nScreenshot by Shan Abdul - NAR\nIn case none of the fixes work, you can reinstall the software.\n9. Reinstall the Software\nBefore you reinstall the software, uninstall it and delete any of the associated system files that might still be lurking inside your computer.\nMUO Report: Subscribe and never miss what matters\nStay updated with the latest tech trends, expert tips, and product reviews in the world of technology with MUO's Newsletters.\nSubscribe\nBy subscribing, you agree to receive newsletter and marketing emails, and accept our\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n. You can unsubscribe anytime.\nTo do this, go to\nControl Panel > Programs and Features.\nOnce you have located Adobe Acrobat DC, right-click on it and choose\nUninstall.\nNo Attribution Required\nRemove the associated system files by going to the below address on your computer and deleting each file.\nC:\\Users\\<add your username here>\\AppData\\Local\\Adobe\\Acrobat\nNext, you'll need to reinstall the latest Adobe version from Adobe's website.\nConsider switching back to Adobe Acrobat's older version if you are still having trouble even after reinstalling it.\n10. Roll Back to an Older Version of Adobe Acrobat\nWhen a new version of software comes out, it often brings tons of unexpected issues. You can always revert to an older version of Adobe that isn't working correctly after an update. But before you do that, make sure you properly uninstall it.\nOnce you're done uninstalling Acrobat, it's time to download an older version to see if that fixes your problem.\nAdobe\nlets you roll back your copy of Acrobat, and you can use third-party websites that host some older files; however, make sure the source is legit before downloading.\n11. Run a Malware Scan\nIf none of the fixes have worked, ensure the hidden malware is not interrupting the program's operation. You can only do that by running a malware scan. There are several ways to perform a security check in Windows, but we recommend\nusing Windows Defender Offline scan\n, which is easy to use and free.\n12. Check for Conflicting Software\nIf you have more than one\nPDF viewer app\ninstalled on your device and one such app is currently open, then inter-app interference could also cause the problem. To rule out this possibility, you should close all other PDF viewers, make Adobe Acrobat the default app to open PDFs, and open the file in the app.\nOpen PDF With Ease in Adobe Acrobat\nIf you have followed the fixes mentioned above, Adobe Acrobat should be able to open your PDFs again.

Acrobat Reader is crashing when opening locally stored PDF files, affecting many users. Workarounds include turning off 'New Adobe Experience', opening Acrobat offline, and reverting to the 2014 version.","raw_content":"How to Fix Adobe Acrobat Reader Crashing Issue in October 2024: Step-by-Step Solutions\nThis week, Adobe Acrobat Reader users are facing a frustrating problem.  Adobe Acrobat Reader is crashing before you can even look at your PDF file.  I ran into this during an emergency scenario where I must read my Appliance Installation guide.  But I can’t read to page 2 because it crashes.\nThe current release of Adobe Acrobat Reader is crashing when opening locally stored PDF files. One moment, you click to open the document, and ten seconds later, the program closes unexpectedly. This issue affects many people who rely on Acrobat Reader for their essential work.\nFacing Frequent Crashes? You Are Not Alone\nMany users are\nreporting this problem\n. It seems to have just stared in mid-October 2024. You would not be clicking on this article except that you are losing time and productivity because of a stupid error on Adobe’s part.\nIt raises a big question: why does an essential utility like Adobe Acrobat have this issue? Does Adobe test their updates thoroughly before releasing them? Many wonder if they will fix this soon.\nQuick ways to get you back to work\n1. Turn off ‘new Adobe Experience”\nSome users report that you can stop the crashing by turning off “New Adobe Experience”.  Do the following:\nOpen Adobe Reader with no file open.\nOpen the left top corner “Hamburger menu”\nFind the option 3/4 the way down to “Turn off New Adobe Experience”\nClose Acrobat and reboot your PC.\n2. Unplug the internet before opening Adobe\nIt seems apparent that the entire problem is that Acrobat Reader is trying to access online resources to show you the “Upsell” module that Adobe inserted in the October 2024 release.  Acrobat will work fine if it is offline.  So before you open your locally saved document, just turn off your Wi-Fi (Airplane mode) or remove the internet cable from your PC.\n3. Revert to the 2014 version of Adobe Reader v11\nUninstall Adobe Reader 2024\nInstall Adobe Reader 11 from this link:\nhttps://www.filehorse.com/download-adobe-acrobat-reader-dc/18843/download/\nDuring the installation, select the option to turn off “check for updates”. This is heavenly!\nMarvel in the fact that for the last decade, Adobe has not introduced a single useful feature that was not already in Reader from 2014.  The older release is twice as fast, works like a charm, and contains an option to turn off productivity-damaging auto updates.\nWarning about Adobe Reader 2024 Install\nSome people might be tempted to uninstall and resinstall Adobe 2024 from the Adobe website.  However, doing this will bring you into something truly evil.\nIf you try to install Adobe Reader from the Acrobat website, it will, without your permission, install McAfee Antivirus.  So, while reinstalling Adobe Reader 2024 will not solve the problem, it will introduce a completely new problem that will take you another 10-15 minutes to resolve.\nThe McCafee install takes 10 times longer than the Adobe install.  You then have to go through the effort of Uninstalling McAfee, which will add to your suffering.  Corporations who allow this type of piggyback install ought to be sued for the simple loss of productivity.\nDon’t Reach Out to Customer Support\nClearly,\nAdobe customer support is clueless\n. They cannot offer guidance on your specific situation.  It is just a total waste of time.  Save your energy and post to a public forum like Reddit or Stack Overflow.\nHow a simple bug in an essential tool becomes a burden to every business in the US.\nAdobe has become a standard tool for many people. However, users often face frustrating problems. One of the biggest issues is when Adobe fails to load correctly. The reason is that Adobe is trying to load advertising. It is also loading an upsell module. This module does not load for many users. When this happens, people cannot open their documents. It causes delays and confusion, and many users feel annoyed and overwhelmed.\nIt is funny that the 2014 version of Adobe offers the same features 2024 version, but runs faster and has a mode to not auto-update. The big difference is that the 2014 version does not spam users with advertising. Users often feel annoyed with constant ads. For ten years now, Adobe has not provided any valuable new features. Instead, it has focused on pushing unwanted ads. This situation feels very outdated.\nWe’re looking at you, Microsoft\nIt reminds people of Microsoft Windows. Many users remember\nwhen Windows XP was useful\n. Today, newer versions feel slow and filled with ads. Windows seems more like an advertising platform for buggy Azure services. This trend makes people wonder about software design today. Why do companies prioritize ads over usability? Users just want programs that work without distractions.\nSummary\nIf you have experiences or insights on this issue, please share in the comments below. Your feedback could help others facing the same problems. Software should make tasks easier, not harder. Technology should aim to support users, not bombard them with ads. Reverting to an older version may seem like a step back. However, it can sometimes lead to a more efficient experience. Consider the balance between innovation and user satisfaction.

With the arrival of Windows 11 as well as multiple updates for Windows 10, problems have started to arise in which some applications quit unexpectedly, or the overall performance of the computer drops. Fortunately, there are ways to fix this, and generally, this shouldn't take long.\nIn this article\nPart 1.\nThe Reason for PDF Reader Crash\nPart 2.\nHow to Fix PDF Reader Crashes in Windows 11/10\nPart 3.\nChoose PDFelement for Smooth Use\nPart 1. The Reason for PDF Reader Crash\nThere is no perfect software. It is important to bear in mind that practically all technology evolves day by day and it is normal that, with the arrival of new updates or even operating systems such as the popular Windows 11, some programs may present performance problems or even crash out of nowhere. Generally, software development companies develop updates so that their software is bug-free, but it is important to recognize that these types of problems can emerge at any time.\nPart 2. How to Fix PDF Reader Crashes in Windows 11/10\nAdobe Acrobat PDF Reader is arguably the most popular desktop software for viewing PDF documents, and many people have experienced problems with it. This does not mean that the software is bad. There are too many factors that can affect the performance of software, among them, are temporary files, settings, network permissions, Plug-in, operating system, updates, etc. For this reason, there are several procedures that could fix Adobe Acrobat Reader problems.\nMethod 1. Install or update the Acrobat Reader to the latest version\nAdobe Acrobat Reader is like any other software. These need to be updated with relative constancy to function properly. Most of the programs request Internet access permissions from the user so that they are automatically updated every time there is a new version available. However, it is likely that due to Windows Firewall or user-designated permissions, Adobe Acrobat Reader is unable to update itself. However, solving this is not difficult at all.\nStep 1: Uninstall the old Adobe Acrobat Reader Version\nBefore installing the updated version of Adobe Acrobat Reader it is recommended that you remove the previous installation to ensure a clean installation. In the Windows menu, you will find the \"\nSettings\n\" button, click and choose the \"\nApps\n\" option. Once there you will find a list with all the programs that are installed on your computer. Choose Adobe Acrobat Reader and click on \"\nUninstall\n\".\nStep 2: Install the Acrobat Reader latest version\nNow, all you have to do is visit the official website of Adobe Acrobat Reader and click on the “\ndownload”\nbutton. When the download is finished, you just have to open the installer and follow the steps indicated.\nMethod 2. Disable protected view\nThere is a feature in Adobe Acrobat Reader that allows you to open PDF documents in a read-only mode. This mode is designed for security purposes because in this way it prevents these documents from infecting your computer in case they contain any malware but it can also generate problems when a document has graphic elements or images and as a result, it is possible that Adobe Acrobat Reader crash.\nTo deactivate the \"\nProtected View\n\" mode, you must open Adobe Acrobat Reader, without loading any PDF to prevent the program from crashing, click on the \"\nEdit\n\" menu and select the \"\nPreferences\n\" option. Now go to the \"\nSecurity (Enhanced)\n\" section and check the \"\nOff\n\" option in the \"\nProtected View\n\" option. To finish, confirm the changes and click \"\nOk\n\".\nWondershare PDFelement\nSimplify how people interact and communicate with PDF documents using intuitive and powerful PDF tools.\nTry It Free\nTry It Free\nTry It Free\nLearn More >\nMethod 3. Use a different Windows user account\nWindows maintains specific temporary files and settings for each account that is registered on the system. This is intended to provide a smoother and more personalized user experience, but it can also be the cause of some programs not working properly. Windows accounts can have different permissions and if the one you are using does not have permissions to modify files, this could cause PDF Reader to crash.\nThe most immediate solution is to use a different account as a temporary solution. Try using an account with administrator permissions and if the account you already used had administrator permissions, do not rule out this option because, as I mentioned earlier, sometimes this problem is caused by your account settings.\nMethod 4. Turn off applications running in the background\nIt may seem a bit obvious but one of the most common reasons related to this type of problem is the lack of memory. These types of problems have existed since computers have existed. RAM memory is a limited resource available to your computer that allows it to work with the information it reads from your disk and despite the fact that Windows 11, as well as most programs, are designed to efficiently take advantage of this resource, it is possible that if you keep several applications open in the background at the same time, you may experience performance problems that prevent you from working with documents that have graphic elements or high-resolution images. Next, I will show you how to solve this.\nStep 1: Open Task Manager\nThe first thing you need to do is open Task Manager, this can be done in various ways. One of them is through the Windows taskbar. Right click on the Windows button, this will display a menu of options, now click on the \"\nTask Manager\n\" option.\nStep 2: Turn off background processes\nYou should now see the “\nTask Manager”\nwindow. In this window you will be able to find listed all the processes that your computer is executing at the moment, in addition, in the upper right, you will see a summary of what the percentage of use of your resources is. In the Apps section, you can find programs that you probably already know you are using, but below this section, you will find the background processes. These are processes that you may not need to use right now and are safe to shut down. Right-click on any of them and click on \"\nend process\n\". This will free up memory and make Adobe Reader less likely to crash.\nMethod 5. Troubleshoot plug-ins conflicts\nAdobe Acrobat Reader allows the installation of plug-ins to add additional functionalities to those offered by the software natively, and although these are generally tested so that they do not cause any conflicts, there are some circumstances in which these can cause problems. The solution to this is as simple as removing those Plug-ins. To do this you need to go to the location where these are installed and delete them manually. If you consider it prudent, you can first make a backup and try to remove them one by one to identify which one is causing problems. The default location for the Reader Plug-ins folder in Program Files \\ Adobe \\ Acrobat 8.0 \\ Reader \\ Plug_ins.\nPart 3. Choose PDFelement for Smooth Use\nA good option is to use PDFelement as an alternative. This software is developed by Wondershare and offers a variety of PDF document management tools. This software is extremely easy and intuitive to use, you just need to go to the Wondershare official website, download and install it.

The crash you’re seeing (ntdll.dll with exception code 0xc0000409) usually indicates a conflict at the system level rather than just Acrobat itself. Let’s try a few steps to isolate the cause:\n1. Check the document source\nDoes this happen with all PDFs or only specific ones?\nTry opening a simple/local PDF (not from email/cloud/network drive) to see if the behavior is consistent.\n2. Run Reader in Protected Mode OFF (for testing only)\nGo to\nEdit > Preferences > Security (Enhanced)\n.\nTemporarily disable\nProtected Mode at startup\n.\nRestart Reader and check if the crash still occurs.\nIf it works, the issue may be due to conflicts with other software or drivers.\n3. Repair or Reset Acrobat Installation\nFrom the\nHelp > Repair Installation\noption in Reader.\nIf that doesn’t help, run a\nclean uninstall\nusing the\nAdobe Acrobat Cleaner Tool\nand then reinstall fresh.\n4. Try preference reset:\nSometimes, ntdll.dll crashes happen due to graphics drivers.\nTry preference reset:\nhttps://adobe.ly/3JJ3ab1\n.\n5. Create a new Windows user profile\nCorrupt user profiles can trigger ntdll.dll crashes. Testing with a new profile will rule this out.\n6. Advanced: Collect Crash Dumps\nIf Reader is crashing (and not just freezing), we also need crash logs:\nInstructions:\nhttps://adobe.ly/44afCIz\nOnce collected, upload the logs to any cloud drive (e.g., OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox) and share the link with us.\nLet us know how it works.\nBest regards,\nTariq | Adobe Community Team\n|\nMeet Acrobat Studio\nT\nTariq Ahmad\nCorrect answer\nCommunity Manager\nForum|Forum|5 months ago\nSeptember 2, 2025\n@edp_5771\nHi Luca,\nThanks for reaching out, and sorry for the troubled experience.\nThank you for sharing the detailed error logs — that’s very helpful.

Since about 2 months the software has however started to make problems when i try to safe the files after i highlight things or comment in the documents. First i only had the problem with one file but it has increasingly happened to more and more different documents within which i am not able to safe the changes i made. Since i am using the German Version i get this notification:\n\"Das Dokument konnte nicht gespeichert werden.  Beim Lesen dieses Dokuments ist ein Problem aufgetreten (135).\"\nI have tried a few different things that were suggested online such as opening the file in google chrome and saving it again but didn´t do anything. I furthermore reinstalled Acrobat Reader several times but this neither helped.

I am creating PDF files in DataCAD (Software for Architects) The error I am receiving only occurs when I make pdf files on 8.5 x 11 size paper. I am not able to read / review them as I get that silly error code. However, my pdf file did open correctly in Edge. Any ideas as to why Adobe Acrobat is having the issues?\nThank you, sir.\nRod\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2024-02-24T17:39:41+00:00\nHi, I am Dave, I will help you with this.\nIf you right click the same PDF file that is producing that error in Adobe Acrobat and select Open With - Edge Browser, does that same PDF file open correctly in Edge?\nSorry for the delay\nI don't use Microsoft Edge '\nI use Google chrome instead and made it inside windows setting my default browser.\nI opened it in Google and it successfully opened without any error, but if I save the file pdf  through Google the error will still appear.\nThe only way I tried and found successful is to save the file ( print) , however, the outcome will be shown image ( i.e. you can't do search for a word or a phrase inside the certain file.\nAnd second,  its size will be very large, for example if its first size is  (5 mg) it will be increasing to 50 mg , and even to compress the file, it will not lessen the size more than ( 1 megabyte)  You see!\nThen I need to go online and use OCR  ...\nThis way is surely solving the problem and any message of error will not appear.\nThe problem is with font as I see, but it is already checked ( local fonts )   so why  ?\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nDaveM121\n•\n841.8K\nReputation points\n•\nIndependent

A “use after free” flaw happens when a program tries to access data in a memory location that was previously freed. If a malicious actor manages to deploy malicious code in that freed piece of memory real estate, it could be executed on the device and, consequently, compromised.\nIt was discovered by cybersecurity researcher Haifei Li, who created a sandbox platform called EXPMON, designed to detect advanced zero-day exploits. After multiple files were submitted to the platform, the flaw was discovered, and with it the fact that it is being actively exploited in the wild. The silver lining here is that the weaponized .PDF files were not deploying any\nmalware\n, but were simply crashing targeted endpoints, which could also mean that the PoC is still in its infancy or experimental stage.\nA fix is out there\nHowever, now that the news is out, it is also safe to assume that different threat actors will start looking for unpatched Adobe Acrobat Reader variants to use. Therefore, it is pivotal that IT admins apply the fix as soon as possible.\nWhile we don’t know who is using it, or against whom, we do know that it all begins with a weaponized .PDF document, so it’s safe to assume that the attack starts with a phishing email. PDF files are often used as invoices, purchase orders, and similar.\nAdobe released a patch last month, which did not properly address the problem - but the bug was ultimately fixed earlier this week, and was given a new tracking number - CVE-2024-41869.\nVia\nBleepingComputer\nMore from TechRadar Pro\nAdobe Acrobat Reader has a serious security flaw, so update now\nHere's a list of the\nbest firewalls\naround today\nThese are the\nbest endpoint security\ntools right now\nAre you a pro?

After that, duplicate Adobe icons appear in the taskbar. Do you even test your software before releasing it?\n14\nvotes\nAntonio\nshared this idea\n·\nAug 7, 2025\n·\nReport…\nReport…\n·\nDelete…\n·\nAdmin →\nTweet\nAn error occurred while saving the comment\nTeh S Samuel\ncommented\n·\nOctober 3, 2025 2:05 AM\n·\nReport\nReport\n·\nEdit…\n·\nDelete…\nWhen using Adobe Acrobat Reader on Windows 11 with an extended screen setup, moving a PDF document window from one monitor to another causes the taskbar to display duplicate thumbnails for that single document. For example, opening 3 documents results in 6 thumbnails after dragging the windows between screens. Only 3 actual windows are open.\nThis seems to happen when monitors have different DPI scaling, and the issue persists even after switching between tabbed and windowed document modes. No other apps (e.g. browsers, Foxit, MS Word) exhibit this behavior under similar conditions.\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Use a dual-monitor setup with different scaling/resolution.\n2. Open 1–3 PDFs in Adobe Acrobat Reader (windowed mode).\n3. Drag the windows across monitors.\n4.

Thank you, Adobe! This makes life easier for users who save PDF docs in Acrobat throughout the day.\nUPDATE 7/17/2022:\nLess than 2 years after Adobe fixed it, the Acrobat Reader file save bug is back. Request to Adobe to fix the regression.\nI’ve been an ardent user and supporter of Adobe’s\nPortable Document Format\n(PDF) and\nAdobe Acrobat\nsoftware from its very early days. The ability to create and exchange documents using any platform or software, and be assured the documents would display and print as created, with their original fonts, graphics and layout in tact. Adobe found great success with Acrobat and PDF, and it quickly became the preferred file format to exchange print-ready documents, forms and digital publications.\nOver the years, I’ve had an interesting ride with Acrobat, tried many competing PDF viewers and creators, but settled on the current generation of Acrobat Reader DC. It makes consuming PDF docs arguably a more pleasant experience than many of its competitors. Sure, web browsers such as Chrome and Edge can display PDFs too, and so can many other reader apps. But Adobe still offers the best experience by far. Your mileage may vary.\nAcrobat Reader DC isn’t free from its quirks and flaws. One of the more annoying ones, and one I hadn’t noticed until I switched from\nNitro\nand made Acrobat Reader DC the default, is a simple, rather silly UI bug Adobe refuses to acknowledge or fix.\nTo Save, or to Save As?\nLike most Windows apps, Acrobat Reader DC has the\nSave\n(\nCTRL\n+\nS\n) and\nSave As\n(\nCTRL\n+\nSHIFT\n+\nS\n) options on the\nFile\nmenu.\nThe\nSave\nand\nSave As\noptions on Adobe Acrobat Reader DC’s\nFile\nmenu look like every other Windows app\nYou open a PDF file, highlight text, add a comment or signature or make any other changes to it, and then use the convenient\nCTRL\n+\nS\nkeyboard shortcut, or click\nFile\n>\nSave\nor the save icon on the ribbon/toolbar. You expect Acrobat Reader DC to simply save the file without further ado.\nBut Acrobat Reader DC surprises you by opening the\nSave As\ndialog. You try it a few times, making sure you’re not accidentally choosing\nSave As\n. It’s the same behavior every time. You’re not imagining it. Unlike most Windows apps, the\nSave\nand\nSave As\ncommands  in Acrobat Reader DC do exactly the same thing!\nYou’re not imagining it. Unlike most Windows apps, the\nSave\nand\nSave As\ncommands in Acrobat Reader DC do exactly the same thing!\nAdobe Acrobat Reader DC’s annoying behavior when using the\nSave\nfunction to save files\nThis awkward behavior forces the user to (2)\nSelect the folder\n(it defaults to the folder where the file resides) and (3) Click\nSave\n. (4) This, in turn, brings up the\nConfirm Save As\ndialog, informing you that\n<filename> already exists. Do you want to replace it?\nYou must click\nYes\nto complete saving the file.\nBut you’re only trying to save the existing file! You used\nSave\n, not\nSave As\n! Your mind has been trained throughout its adult life to use\nCTRL\n+\nS\nin every Windows app and expect the file to be saved, no questions asked! In fact, it’s a reflex action. Your fingers act even before your mind can send them a signal to slide over to the\nCTRL\nand\nS\nkeys and press them just enough, almost like a master pianist capping off a brilliant set on a high note.\nIf you regularly use Acrobat Reader DC to read and review many PDF docs throughout the day, it can drive you crazy.\nWhat Adobe can do to fix it\nLast May, I\nreported the bug to Adobe on Twitter\n. Adobe politely informed me “\nit’s not a bug, it’s by design\n“. It asked me to file a feature request using\nAdobe Acrobat Reader – Feature Request/Bug Report Form\n, which I promptly did. But it remains unchanged to this day. Broken for me, by design for Adobe.\nHi Bharat,\nthis is not a bug, this is As designed behavior of the application. You may file a future request and help us with your comment how this affect your workflow:\nhttps://t.co/oI5RbH02Mu\n^TD\n— Adobe Acrobat (@Acrobat)\nMay 8, 2018\nIt’s easy to write these off as minor, “fit-and-finish” bugs, or even as “by design”. I’ve had more than my share of bugs closed as “by design” or “won’t fix” in the past.\n(Yes, there are some bugs dev teams won’t have the bandwidth to fix, release after release, mainly because they’re low priority.)\nBut that was before\n#CloudCadence\nchanged the world forever. Great user experience is more important than ever. “Delight the user” is the credo most teams live by.\nI tried to find the Windows desktop applications\nUX\nguide, or any public Microsoft developer/UX guidance that explicitly states what\nSave\nand\nSave As\nshould do. Nothing!\nI asked Perry Holzknecht, Sr UX Designer at Microsoft, for any guidance from Microsoft. His response:\n“I’m not finding anything particularly meaningful, which may be because everyone over 10 years old already knows they are two similar but separate actions.”\nAdobe’s\nAcrobat Reader DC documentation\ndoes imply these are two separate actions.:\nTo save changes to the current file, choose\nFile > Save\n.\nTo save a copy of a PDF, choose\nFile > Save As\n.\nWith that said, here are some of the fixes Adobe can consider.\nThe simplest fix:\nWhen the user selects\nSave\n, do not open the\nSave As\ndialog box unless it’s a new file. Just save the file. Standard behavior in Windows apps,\nincluding Microsoft Office\nand\nNitro PDF\n. No surprises. No unnecessary dialog boxes and confirmations. Life is good!\nAdd a setting:\nPerhaps Adobe UX experts have usability data or customer feedback to indicate most users don’t want the risk of accidentally overwriting files by using the\nSave\nfunction. In that case, Adobe can default to the current non-standard behavior and add a setting to change it to the standard behavior of Windows apps.\nUsers who find the default non-standard\nSave\nbehavior annoying have an option to revert to the expected behavior. Everybody’s happy!\nSimplify\n: If either of the above fixes are not acceptable for any reason, perhaps Adobe should consider keeping\na single Save command\nthat asks for filename/location and a confirmation dialog every time. Not ideal, but it’ll avoid the confusion of having separate\nSave\nand\nSave As\ncommands that do the exact same thing. Minimalism fans, rejoice!\nIt’ll be interesting to see which option Adobe chooses. Or it may decide to go with a fourth option – do nothing. In which case, it’ll be time to switch to a competing PDF app.\nA non-solution: Disabling Acrobat Reader’s Protected Mode\nYou can enable the intended file saving functionality by disabling\nProtected Mode\nin\nEdit\n>\nPreferences\n>\nSecurity (Enhanced)\n, as reader\nLorian suggested\nin comments, but this disables the\nsandboxing\nfunctionality.\nProtected Mode\nis a useful security feature. It prevents malicious PDF documents from launching arbitrary executable files or writing to system directories or the Windows Registry.\nAppContainer Isolation\n, a Windows feature, blocks application process from writing and reading outside of its boundaries.\nDisabling Protected Mode is a significant security downgrade and completely unnecessary\n.\nAdobe just needs to fix this so the user experience isn’t broken.\nShare\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n{\n10\ncomments… read them below or\nadd one\n}\nDean S\nFebruary 3, 2020 at 2:51 pm\nThanks so much for this, I thought I was going insane!\nReply\nLorian Bartle\nFebruary 6, 2020 at 12:54 pm\nThis is an extremely annoying feature and I agree completely with your post. I would like to point out however that standard save behavior can be restored by going to Edit -> Preferences -> Security (Enhanced) and disabling the Enable Protected Mode at startup option.\nIt is unclear to me why standard saving behavior is considered a security risk, but there it is.\nReply\nBharat Suneja\nMarch 17, 2020 at 8:49 pm\nThanks for sharing! That worked. Albeit, the security trade-off needs to be investigated.\nUpdate:\nPost updated with details of what you lose. Bottomline, don’t do it. Ask Adobe to fix it instead.\nReply\nJosiane\nJune 16, 2020 at 11:48 am\nTHANKS for describing the problem I am experiencing with such accuracy and great suggestions. I filed the Feature Request/Bug Report Form, and voted for 2 identical requests.\nReply\nWolf\nAugust 7, 2020 at 6:58 am\nI fully agree. 5 clicks instead of a single keyboard shortcut which is universally understood and expected for decades is a HUGE usability and ergonomics mess-up. Broken by design indeed.\nReply\nAbel\nNovember 26, 2020 at 9:11 am\nHi!\nYou’ve written above that this has been solved with a new version.\nNot in the one I use at work.\nWhich is the version number that solved it?\n(I want to ask the IT department if it is possible to update to that version)\nThanks!\nReply\nBharat Suneja\nDecember 11, 2020 at 3:43 pm\n@Abel, not sure which version solved it. I’m currently on Continuous Release v 2020.013.20074 and haven’t seen the issue since August.\nReply\nAJ\nJune 25, 2021 at 6:18 am\nStill face the issue in version 2021.005.20048\nReply\ndann\nSeptember 8, 2021 at 4:22 pm\nNot sure if this is the right place to whinge about this, but, Adobe Pro DC no longer has Alt+F+A shortcut for File/Save As.\n‘Save As’ is still there in the File menu, but there is no shortcut ‘A’ to invoke it. You have to do Ctrl+Shift+S without opening the menu at all.\nIt used to be there. That key combination is burned in my brain because that’s how EVERY OTHER PIECE OF SOFTWARE DOES ‘SAVE AS’.\nDumbest piece of software on the planet.\nReply\nBharat Suneja\nSeptember 8, 2021 at 5:34 pm\nThat’s right. Another move towards inconsistent user experiences, @Adobe.\nNonetheless, I’m glad Save As works as Save As now. CTRL-SHIFT-S works (and the one I’m used to).\nReply\nCancel reply\nLeave a Comment\nPrevious post:\nManaging Email: Two Outlook annoyances you can eliminate quickly\nNext post:\nGet Azure Storage

All Attachments are regular PDF files.\nPDF files were created using 3rd party component.\nIf I open PDF width Adobe Reader all attachments are listed. The thing is that 2 of those 5 file attachments do not want to be displayed or saved. Acrobat Reader does not message anything. Just does nothing.\nThen I created another PDF file and attached those two \"problematic\" PDF files.\nIt works like a breeze.\nIt appears there is a bug in Adobe Reader. I am using the latest version as of today.\nThe thing is that Foxit and Nitro have no problems whatsoever to display all attachments correctly.\nView PDF\nLike\n1 person likes this\nReply\nSubscribe\nThis topic has been closed for replies.\nT\nTest Screen Name\nLegend\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nJune 20, 2023\nMay well be that the third party component is creating borderline faulty PDFs. This sort of thing happens a lot, and it's easy to assume that the software that trips over the fault is itself faulty. I don't suppose you can share this problem file publicly, but if you can create a sample file with the same problem, you can upload it here and someone may take a look. Overall, though, your time may be better spent working with the support for the 3rd party component.\n2 replies\nLike\nReply\nD\ndusan3060872081n3\nAuthor\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nJune 20, 2023\nThanks for the suggestion. I will create an example and post it here 🙂\nHowever, even before chatGPT technologies were born it was a good practice to respond with some info/action if input data does not comply with a host's standards. Acrobat Reader in this case. Saying nothing is just not good enough. For sure there is a reason why Adore Reader does not react when a file attachment is clicked. Right-click shows the enabled context menu. But no action after a click. Popping out a message to indicate the reason is hygienic minimum in this case. Asking third-party development to explain why Adobe Reader has problems does not seem the right approach. However, it could be the last resource to try out 🙂\nLike\nReply\nShow 1 more reply\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nTo post, reply, or follow discussions, please sign in with your Adobe ID.\nSign in\nSign in to Adobe Community\nTo post, reply, or follow discussions, please sign in with your Adobe ID.\nSign in\nEnter your E-mail address.

These challenges can arise for various reasons, including outdated software or system compatibility problems.\nIn some cases, background applications or system configurations may interfere with proper functionality. Thus, addressing these issues is important for restoring functionality and ensuring smooth file access. This guide explores the root causes behind the most frequent problems and provides practical solutions to get your PDF reader back on track.\nIn this article\nPart 1.

Why Adobe Acrobat Reader Has Stopped Working?\nWhen\n“\nAdobe Acrobat reader has stopped working,\" identifying the causes is important to fix the issue. Addressing the causes ensures smoother functionality and restores productivity. Below, we will explain several common reasons for helping you resolve the issue.\nCauses of Adobe Acrobat Not Working\nDescription\nOutdated Version\nWithout updates, the software may freeze or fail to open files that encounter this error. To resolve this, you must check and install the latest updates.\nIncorrect Settings\nMisconfigured preferences can block certain features or cause the software to malfunction. Resetting preferences to default settings often resolves these issues and restores your files easily.\nDamaged Files\nSometimes, the problem lies in the document rather than the software. So, you should test the application with a different file to confirm the issue or consider repairing the file using a specialized tool.\nCorrupted Installation\nIt results in errors or causes the software to stop functioning entirely. Therefore, users have to ensure the installation process completes without interruptions to prevent file corruption.\nPart 2. Some Easy Fixes To \"Adobe Reader Has Stopped Working\"\nAfter knowing the key reasons for the \"Adobe Reader not working” error, let’s move on to discuss the solutions. Depending on the reason behind the error, you can utilize any of the following fixes.\n1. Consider Updating Adobe Reader To the Latest Version\nOutdated versions of Adobe Reader often contain bugs or performance limitations that lead to unexpected crashes. That’s why the program regularly releases updates and addresses these issues. Chances are you're facing an \"Adobe Reader is not responding” error because you’re using an outdated version. Thus, update your PDF reader following the given steps to fix bugs and enhance compatibility with modern PDF files:\nInstructions\n: After launching the reader tool, press the \"\nMenu\"\ntab from the top corner of the screen. From the drop-down list, hover over the\n\"Help\"\noption and then\n\"Check for Updates.\"\nAfter the software is done finding an update, install it to resolve the error.\n2. Perform Repair Installation Function\nA corrupted or incomplete installation can result in the reader app failing to operate correctly. This is because files that were not properly installed or became damaged over time may prevent the program from opening.\nFortunately, the tool includes a built-in repair feature designed to fix such issues without requiring a complete reinstallation. To solve the “Adobe Acrobat Reader has stopped working\" error, follow the steps below:\nStep 1.\nOnce again, access the\n“Menu”\ntab from the top right side and access the drop-down menu. From the options list, tap the\n“Help”\noption to access its various settings. Here, you need to choose the\n“Repair Installation”\noption.\nStep 2.\nThe software will show a pop-up screen confirming whether you want to repair it or not. You need to press the \"\nYes\"\nbutton to continue with the repair process.\n3. Check If File Is Corrupted/Damaged\nWhen experiencing issues like “Acrobat Reader is not responding,\" the problem might not lie with the software but with the file itself. Corrupted or damaged PDF files can trigger errors, which prevent users from opening or reading the content. This can happen due to incomplete downloads or interruptions during file transfers. When faced with corrupted PDFs, using a specialized tool like\nRepairit\nsimplifies the process.\nThis reliable repair software is designed to recover damaged files efficiently.

Reconfigure Preferences Across Adobe Reader Settings\nIncorrect preferences within the reader software can sometimes cause it to malfunction. You may have changed settings related to security or viewing preferences that may conflict with the PDF files you’re opening.\nBy resetting or reconfiguring these preferences, you can fix the “Adobe Reader not working”\nissue caused by custom settings. For a detailed guide, you can follow the steps outlined below:\nStep 1.\nCommence the process by accessing the\n“Menu”\ntab from the top right corner of the screen. When the drop-down appears, go to the\n“Preferences”\nwindow to configure its settings.\nStep 2.\nWhen you reach the new screen, access the\n\"Security (Enhanced)\"\ntab from the left menu. Here, you need to uncheck the\n“Enable Protected Mode at Startup”\noption. Finally, click the\n“OK”\nbutton at the bottom of the screen to save your preferences and restart the software to see changes.\n5. Clear Temp Files on Run Program\nWhen you are using this PDF reading software, it creates temporary files that can interfere with its functionality later on. Over time, these files gather and may become corrupted, which leads to errors like \"\nAdobe Acrobat Reader not responding.”\nBy clearing these files, you can refresh the program's operations caused by outdated or broken data. In the following section, you will find detailed steps for clearing temporary files in Windows:\nStep 1.\nBy pressing the \"\nWindows + R\"\nkey, open the \"\nRun\"\nprogram on your PC. Then, write \"\n%temp%\"\nin the dialog box and press the\n\"OK\"\nbutton.\nStep 2.\nOnce the program takes you to the temporary files on your PC, find and select all the Adobe files. When selected, right-click on them and press the\n\"Delete\"\nicon on the pop-up screen. Now, restart the software and check if the error is resolved.\n6. Check If Windows OS Needs Updating\nSometimes, the issue lies in system compatibility rather than the software itself. An outdated Windows OS may not support newer versions of the Acrobat Reader. That's why Microsoft releases regular updates, which include important performance improvements and compatibility enhancements.\nWhen any such update appears, you need to install it as a priority. If your Acrobat Reader is not working,\nmake sure to follow the given instructions to check for Windows updates:\nInstructions:\nBegin the process by going to the PC settings and accessing the\n“Windows Update”\ntab from the left menu. Here, you need to press the\n“Check for Updates”\nbutton to manually find and install newer versions of Windows.\n7. Use Other PDF Reader/Editor\nWhen none of the above solutions resolve the issue, you should switch to another PDF editor tool. Other software like\nPDFelement\nis a good alternative when you are looking for offline tools. On the other hand, you can rely on\nHiPDF\nto edit documents online without downloading any software.

issues","summary":"The user's enterprise requires 32-bit Adobe Reader and Office 365, but Adobe no longer offers standalone Acrobat purchases. Installing 64-bit Acrobat breaks the primary application, and reinstalling 32-bit Reader doesn't work.","raw_content":"Reddit - The heart of the internet\nSkip to main content\nGo to Adobe\nr/Adobe\n•\nThenSuccess8469\nAdobe Reader getting eaten by Acrobat and why it's a problem\nSo in my enterprise our primary application is 32-bit and requires Adobe and Office to function correctly. Part of this is that we need the 32-bit reader and the 32-bit O365 because the 64 bit versions cause compatibility issues. We used to circumvent this issue for the purposes of creating and editing PDFs with certain users by having 32-bit Reader as the default for our primary application and the standalone versions of Acrobat like 2020 and 2017 as a secondary program. Well adobe doesn't offer standalone Acrobat purchases anymore and they expire this year so we acquired a license to Acrobat 64-bit and tried installing it in tandem with Reader 32-bit. This did not work, Acrobat automatically cannibalizes Reader and I can't circumvent it. This stops my user from either using our company's primary tool as the 64-bit Acrobat breaks it, or tell the user they can't create/edit PDFs because we had to focus on Reader 32-bit being the only install. I'm not sure if anybody has a workaround, but when I tried to put Reader 32-bit back it told me it was already installed and deleted my .exe so I feel like I'm at a loss.\nRead more\nShare\nReddit Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nUser Agreement\nYour Privacy Choices\nAccessibility\nReddit, Inc. © 2026.

But that doesn’t mean that you won’t occasionally run into a technological snafu here and there.\nFrustrated with asking yourself, “Why won’t my computer open PDF files”? Let’s figure out exactly why your PDF won’t open. There could be a few reasons. Here are some of the most common culprits to consider:\nYour laptop doesn’t have a PDF reader installed.\nYour PDF reader or preferred program is out of date and needs an update.\nYour PDF application is potentially damaged or needs to be rebooted.\nThe PDF is potentially damaged or tampered with.\nA potential virus or malicious attack is embedded into a PDF file.\nYour laptop has a potential software conflict with the PDF.\nThe PDF is too large for your laptop to process.\nOf course, those are just a few of the most common reasons you can’t open PDF on your laptop. So, if you’re struggling to open a PDF on your laptop, try these tips to resolve the problem:\nInstall a\nreliable PDF reader\n.\nUpdate your current PDF reader or application.\nRe-download the PDF.\nResize the PDF\n.\nScan for malware or viruses.\nDoing these things might help you solve the problem that kept your PDF from opening.\nWhen you can’t open a PDF in Adobe Acrobat, it can be frustrating because you’re already using one of the most reliable PDF editors. What more can you do when your PDF won’t open, even with Adobe Acrobat?\nThere’s a few different things you can do to try and get around potential bugs or permissions issues with Acrobat:\nCheck to see if Adobe Acrobat needs an update, and update it if it does.\nRestart Acrobat after closing all programs running in the background.\nScan to see if the PDF has malware, since Adobe Acrobat could be protecting you by not opening the PDF.\nUnder Advanced Properties, ensure that you are running Adobe as an administrator.\nIf you are confident that the PDF is safe for your device, disable protected mode under advanced security preferences.\nIn case the version of Windows is making it so that your PDF won’t open, run compatibility mode in Acrobat.\nIf none of these options work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Adobe Acrobat or running an older version of Acrobat. There could be something about a recent update that is making it so you can’t open PDF.\nNow that you’ve figured out how to fix the issue when your PDF won’t open, you’re free to work with it.

Running on a run-of-the-mill Asus office desktop.\nI'm attempting to resolve an issue with Acrobat DC. If trying to open a file it just silently crashes in the background with no signs of anything ever opening. In the task manager it will appear briefly..\nIf attempting to open from the desktop or start menu, it will open and give me the generic \"Acrobat has encountered a problem, we'll look for a solution\" message and no other option than to close Adobe.\nI have tried opening in Windows safe mode with the same results. Also tried:\nuninstalling, running Adobe Cleaner Utility, rebooting the PC, then reinstalling.\nRunning install repair from windows settings.\nOpening in every compatibility mode setting available.\nUninstalled, manually cleaned out remnants of Adobe, reinstalled as admin.\nI'm really all out of any options I can think of because any others I have found involve opening adobe and adjusting settings. That's clearly not an option because the furthest I can get is to the generic error message and then I'm forced to close.\nNote: I'm trying to remotely troubleshoot because this PC is a 10hr drive away from me. A fresh windows install isn't feasible with the current tools where the PC is and I REALLY don't want to have to arrange shipping or driving that far for this issue.\nAny help is appreciated.\nRead more\nShare\nTop Posts\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of September 5, 2023\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of September 2023\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2023\nReddit Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nUser Agreement\nYour Privacy Choices\nAccessibility\nReddit, Inc. © 2026.

I've uninstallled and reinstalled several times. I've done a repair. I've chaged it to administrator mode and nothing. In admin mode it comes up with the 'do you want this application to make changes...'. Both yes and no does nothing.\nYou click a PDF and nothing. It appears in Task Manager as Adobe Acrobat (2) and if you keep clicking new ones show up. Eventually a pop up appears saying there is a running error and a click here option with further fix options. None of these work. I found my business partner has had the same issue this week.\nAny advice on how to fix this would be greatly apprecited.\nThanks\nPDF\nGeneral troubleshooting\nLike\nReply\nSubscribe\nCorrect answer\nAnandSri\nHi Jane,\nFrom the other week PDFs would not open. After finding out my business partner has the same issue, I came home and tried launching Adobe Acrobat Reader and noticed this didn't work either.\nTried all of these and nothing. The only one I don't get is solution 4 with the plugins. I see files as application extension but not sure if I should delete these? Thank you for your continued help by the way.\nI am wondering whether it is related to the brand of laptop. We both have HP. I have a seperate Windows laptop and it works fine on there.\nHi Sebastian!\nI hope you are doing well, and apologize for the delayed response and the trouble.\nIf you have tried all the suggestions provided by our Product Expert and the help articles, such as:\nFailed to Connect to DDE Server\nResetting the preferences\nand the issue still persists, please follow these steps:\nUse the\nAcrobat Cleaner Tool\nto uninstall the app.\nRestart your computer.\nInstall all pending mandatory and optional operating system updates.\nReboot your device.\nReinstall\nAcrobat Reader\n.\nIf the issue continues, please collect the\nlogs\nfrom the affected machine and share them with us for further investigation.\nThanks,\nAnand Sri.\njane-e\nCommunity Expert\nForum|Forum|11 months ago\nMarch 1, 2025\nLast wednesday I noticed my Adobe Acrobat Reader Free Version was not opening PDFs.\nBy\n@sebastian_0370\nCan you open a PDF by launching the free Adobe Acrobat Reader, then choosing File > Open?\nI've moved your post from Acrobat to the Acrobat Reader forum.\nJane\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nS\nsebastian_0370\nAuthor\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|11 months ago\nMarch 2, 2025\nHi Jane,\nNo. The application does not open.

Last week Reader wouldn't open PDFs and this week it won't launch at all.\nI found this Help page for Acrobat, and most of it should work for the free Reader. Skip option #2 because Reader does not include the Distiller. Let us know if any of these steps work.\nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/unable-to-launch-acrobat-on-windows.html\nAlso, be sure you are using this link to install Reader:\nhttps://get.adobe.com/reader/\nJane\nLike\nReply\nShow 4 more replies\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nTo post, reply, or follow discussions, please sign in with your Adobe ID.\nSign in\nSign in to Adobe Community\nTo post, reply, or follow discussions, please sign in with your Adobe ID.\nSign in\nEnter your E-mail address.

A month ago, this user's\nAdobe\nAcrobat would crash when attempting to fill in a fillable field in a given PDF. If you leave the PDF alone, it will stay open, but the moment you try to edit it, or fill in a fillable form,\nAdobe\nAcrobat crashes.\nThe user is on Windows 11 Pro and on Adobe Reader Version 2023.008.20533. I've tried uninstalling and re-installing\nAdobe\nAcrobat, removed all anti-virus, and run the Adobe cleaner/uninstall tool and the issue still persists. If anyone has any insight or advice it is greatly appreciated. I have protected view set to 'OFF' as well, as I noticed that suggestion in a lot of articles that dealt with\nAdobe\nAcrobat crashing. If there are log files available, let me know how to provide them or where they are typically stored on a PC.\n[moderator changed the subject for clarity: was Adobe crashes...; corrected Adobe to Acrobat in the text; sanitized the topics]\n[Moderator moved the thread from Acrobat to the Acrobat Reader forum]\nCrash or freeze\nPDF forms\nLike\nS\nM\nY\n21 people like this\nReply\nSubscribe\nCorrect answer\nThorben38241278hz8t\nI have the same issue but discovered something just now, that works at least as a semi-optimal fix.\nIf I open a file directly from the Windows Explorer, the issue occurs, Acrobat crashes as soon as I click a fillable field. If I however first open Acrobat manually and then open a document (either through the Acrobat UI or the Windows Explorer), I am able to fill the fields without problem.\nAcrobat just always has to be open first for some reason\nI hope this helps someone, at least until theres a fix for it\nShow previous replies\nAmal.\nCommunity Manager\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nFebruary 22, 2024\nHi\n@Marshall356087002d3n\nI hope you're doing well, though I'm sorry to hear about the issue you're experiencing.\nCould you please clarify if this problem occurs with a specific PDF file or if it affects all PDFs? It might be helpful to try opening a different PDF to see if the issue persists. If the file is located on a shared network or drive, try downloading it locally onto your computer and then attempting to open it again.\nSince you have the latest version installed, you might want to consider repairing the installation from the help menu (applicable to Windows only) to see if that resolves the issue.\nAnother step to try is resetting the Acrobat preferences. You can follow the instructions outlined in this link:\nHow to Reset Acrobat Preference Settings to Default\n.\nAdditionally, reviewing the suggestions provided in this help page\nAcrobat DC Crashes on Windows OS\nmight offer further insights into resolving the issue.\nLet me know if any of these steps help in resolving the problem.\n~Amal\n2 replies\nLike\nReply\nM\nMarshall356087002d3n\nAuthor\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nFebruary 22, 2024\nHello Amal, Thank you for your message. All of the PDF files are stored locally on her machine. No shared drives are involved. They reside primarily on her desktop, to be specific. We've opened about 12-15 different PDFs, and of those 12-15 there are about 5 that have fillable forms in them. If you immediately try to enter characters into one of the fillable fields then the entire Adobe program crashes. I know we've tried a repair already, but will try that as well as the reset of the preferences and will report back with what I find out. Thank you.\nLike\nReply\nShow 1 more reply\nPowered by Gainsight\nTerms & Conditions\nAccessibility statement\nSign up\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nTo post, reply, or follow discussions, please sign in with your Adobe ID.\nSign in\nSign in to Adobe Community\nTo post, reply, or follow discussions, please sign in with your Adobe ID.\nSign in\nEnter your E-mail address.

It crashes after a 2 or more minutes when opening any pdf file. I've proved that it only happens on the latest update as the problem gets fixed when I roll back to Adobe Acrobat 2025.001.20435.\nI had to disable the automatic update in Adobe as the issue comes back once updated to 2025.001.20458.\nI've tried running AcroCleaner (\nhttps://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/Labs/cleaner.html\n) and deleting all Adobe folders from the following:\nC:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\nC:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\nC:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\LocalLow\nC:\\Program Files\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\nC:\\ProgramData\nC:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\nI've restarted the PC and reinstalled Adobe Acrobat 2025.001.20458 but still crashing.\nThis is happening on Windows 11 64bit machines.

Could you please share the solution here?\nHello @\nsteven_david1975\nI hope you are doing well, and thanks for reaching out. Could you please share more details? Does the app crash when you open it, or while using any specific tool, or while viewing PDFs? Are you on a Mac or Windows machine, and what is the version?\nPlease ensure you have the latest version of Acrobat installed on the machine:\n25.001.20630 Planned update, Aug 18, 2025\n. Check for any pending updates from the Menu > help > check for updates, install the updates, restart the app and the machine, and try again.\nFor testing purposes, create a test user profile, install\nAcrobat\n, and check the performance. You can also try a clean reinstallation using the Acrobat Cleaner\ntool\n, restart the machine, ensure the operating system is updated to the latest version, and install Acrobat.\nIf the issue continues, please provide the following information: the current version of the operating system on your device and the logs from the affected machine. To collect the logs, download and run the Log Collector\ntool\n. Make sure to select all log options and attempt to reproduce the issue. After that, close the Log Collector tool; it will generate the logs along with a log ID. Please share this log ID with us for further investigation.\nThanks,\nAnand Sri.\nMeenakshi Negi\nCommunity Manager\nForum|Forum|9 months ago\nApril 23, 2025\nHi\nGKM25EFB,\nThank you for reaching out.\nPlease try the troubleshooting steps suggested in the following help document:\nhttps://adobe.ly/3EkQWmL\n.\nIf the issue still occurs, please collect the crash logs using the diagnostic tool.

This is not happening only on one machine. The latest update\n2025.001.20458 just keeps making Adobe Acrobat crash. I had no other choice but to roll it back to 2025.001.20435 and disable the auto update in Adobe Acrobat and Creative Cloud. I am hoping Adobe will fix this with a new update.\n6 replies\nLike\nReply\nAnandSri\nCommunity Manager\nForum|Forum|9 months ago\nApril 24, 2025\nHello!\nI hope you are doing well, and we are sorry for the trouble.\nCould you please check if you have any pending updates of the latest Acrobat build from the menu > help > check for updates?

Several updates have been released since, with some changes in this area.\nIf the issue is still reproducible, kindly help us with diagnostic and crash logs:\nDiagnostic logs:\nRun the Adobe Diagnostic Utility\nDownload the utility from this link:\nhttps://adobe.ly/4nqkAbE\nOpen the tool and click Start Diagnostics.\nEnsure Advanced Logging is enabled.\nLaunch Acrobat and reproduce the crash or freeze (open the “What’s New” window).\nOnce the issue occurs, return to the utility and click Stop Monitoring.\nCopy the Log ID shown and share it with us here.\nCrash logs:\nCollect Crash Logs. If Acrobat is crashing (and not just freezing), we also need crash logs:\nInstructions:\nhttps://adobe.ly/44afCIz\nOnce collected, upload the logs to any cloud drive (e.g., OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox) and share the link with us.\nBoth types of logs are required.\nBest regards,\nTariq | Adobe Community Team |\nMeet Acrobat Studio\nAfter uninstalling and reinstalling a couple of times, I have gotten it working again for now. I have downloaded another pdf program that I will move to permanently if it happens again and that program has no issues. I am more familiar with Adobe but I cannot go through this time wasting process again.\nlisak81424561\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|6 months ago\nAugust 18, 2025\nI too am having issues with Adobe Acrobat (64-bit) every single time I have to open a pdf and I rely on this program as I open pdf's and work with them consistently every day. This has slowed my ability to work down to a snail's pace just trying to get the program to work correctly. It is not on a network so that is not the problem. I have repaired the installation and that did not change anything. I reboot the system and try again and again, the same issues exist. I open a pdf and it freezes immediately. If it ever unfreezes, any further action other than trying to close it, causes it to freeze up again. For what we pay for these programs, they should work. I used to be able to get a ton of work done and this is super frustrating.\n1 reply\nLike\nR\n1 person likes this\nReply\nlisak81424561\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|6 months ago\nAugust 18, 2025\nAlso noting that I have\nversion 25.001.20577 as well which is the one that is not working.\n5 replies\nLike\nReply\nE\nEthan39008362himt\nAuthor\nParticipating Frequently\nForum|Forum|6 months ago\nAugust 18, 2025\nIs this on your personal computer or with a company?\nTry completely uninstalling adobe, restarting your computer, then reinstalling it.\nIf you have a company managed computer, try having tech support uninstall it from their patch/device manager then reinstalling it through that.\nWhat version of windows are you running, windows 11 24h2?\nLike\nReply\nShow 4 more replies\nJ\njordan_3527\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|6 months ago\nJuly 24, 2025\nI'm also having several end users experiencing slowness, not responding issues since the July update.

We use CCH Engagement and it's rough there especially. But even launching it and a normal PDF from like, their OneDrive that's synced locally and in the cloud. It'll open, temporarily not respond, then let them go. it'll do that here and there while they're in a document.

Launch Acrobat > Help > Repair Acrobat installation.\nIf the issue is still reproducible, try disabling Protected Mode (for troubleshooting only):\nIf you’re facing issues with opening or interacting with PDFs, temporarily disabling Protected Mode can help identify the cause.\nOn Windows:\nGo to Edit > Preferences > Security (Enhanced)\nUncheck “Enable Protected Mode at startup.”\nClick OK and restart Acrobat.\nOn macOS:\nGo to Acrobat > Preferences > Security (Enhanced)\nUncheck “Enable Protected Mode at startup.”\nRestart Acrobat.\n⚠️ Important Disclaimer:\nProtected Mode is a security feature that helps prevent malicious content in PDFs from affecting your system. We recommend disabling it only for testing purposes. Do not open files from unknown sources while it’s off. If this step resolves the issue, we can guide you toward a safer, permanent fix.\nIf the issue is still reproducible, we need your help with logs:\nPlease follow the steps below to collect diagnostic information:\nStep 1: Run the Adobe Diagnostic Utility\nDownload the utility from this link:\nhttps://adobe.ly/4nqkAbE\nOpen the tool and click Start Diagnostics.\nEnsure Advanced Logging is enabled.\nLaunch Acrobat and reproduce the crash or freeze (open the “What’s New” window).\nOnce the issue occurs, return to the utility and click Stop Monitoring.\nCopy the Log ID shown and share it with us here.\nStep 2: Collect Crash Logs (if applicable)\nIf Acrobat is crashing (and not just freezing), we also need crash logs:\nInstructions:\nhttps://adobe.ly/44afCIz\nOnce collected, upload the logs to any cloud drive (e.g., OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox) and share the link with us.\nOnce we have this information, we can escalate the issue appropriately and work toward a resolution.

It crashes after a 2 or more minutes when opening any pdf file. I've proved that it only happens on the latest update as the problem gets fixed when I roll back to Adobe Acrobat 2025.001.20435.\nI had to disable the automatic update in Adobe as the issue comes back once updated to 2025.001.20458.\nI've tried running AcroCleaner (\nhttps://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/Labs/cleaner.html\n) and deleting all Adobe folders from the following:\nC:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\nC:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\nC:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\LocalLow\nC:\\Program Files\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\nC:\\ProgramData\nC:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\nI've restarted the PC and reinstalled Adobe Acrobat 2025.001.20458 but still crashing.\nThis is happening on Windows 11 64bit machines.

Could you please share the solution here?\nHello @\nsteven_david1975\nI hope you are doing well, and thanks for reaching out. Could you please share more details? Does the app crash when you open it, or while using any specific tool, or while viewing PDFs? Are you on a Mac or Windows machine, and what is the version?\nPlease ensure you have the latest version of Acrobat installed on the machine:\n25.001.20630 Planned update, Aug 18, 2025\n. Check for any pending updates from the Menu > help > check for updates, install the updates, restart the app and the machine, and try again.\nFor testing purposes, create a test user profile, install\nAcrobat\n, and check the performance. You can also try a clean reinstallation using the Acrobat Cleaner\ntool\n, restart the machine, ensure the operating system is updated to the latest version, and install Acrobat.\nIf the issue continues, please provide the following information: the current version of the operating system on your device and the logs from the affected machine. To collect the logs, download and run the Log Collector\ntool\n. Make sure to select all log options and attempt to reproduce the issue. After that, close the Log Collector tool; it will generate the logs along with a log ID. Please share this log ID with us for further investigation.\nThanks,\nAnand Sri.\nMeenakshi Negi\nCommunity Manager\nForum|Forum|9 months ago\nApril 23, 2025\nHi\nGKM25EFB,\nThank you for reaching out.\nPlease try the troubleshooting steps suggested in the following help document:\nhttps://adobe.ly/3EkQWmL\n.\nIf the issue still occurs, please collect the crash logs using the diagnostic tool.

This is not happening only on one machine. The latest update\n2025.001.20458 just keeps making Adobe Acrobat crash. I had no other choice but to roll it back to 2025.001.20435 and disable the auto update in Adobe Acrobat and Creative Cloud. I am hoping Adobe will fix this with a new update.\n6 replies\nLike\nReply\nAnandSri\nCommunity Manager\nForum|Forum|9 months ago\nApril 24, 2025\nHello!\nI hope you are doing well, and we are sorry for the trouble.\nCould you please check if you have any pending updates of the latest Acrobat build from the menu > help > check for updates?

I have clients whose Acrobat Pro workflows depend on these folder-level scripts. Fortunately, I warned them not to update Acrobat and to keep version 2025.001.20577.\nWe hope Adobe will release a new update very soon.\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nA\nAlmirRVS\nCorrect answer\nInspiring\nForum|Forum|5 months ago\nAugust 25, 2025\nI’d just like to inform you that update 25.001.20630 solved my problems.

This happens after update 25.001.20630, and I believe it was the same with update 2025.001.20623. The problem occurs whenever I have folder-level scripts\nand\nthe\nShow console on errors and messages\noption is enabled in the Acrobat JavaScript Preferences.\nIf I disable the\nShow console on errors and messages\noption, there is no freezing or crashing, even with folder-level scripts. Likewise, if I open the JavaScript Debugger and keep it open, the issue does not occur.\nThis morning I installed the 25.001.20630 update, performed all the necessary tests related to the folder-level scripts, and everything worked fine. However, as soon as I started working with a PDF form, I realized that\nShow console on errors and messages\nunder JavaScript Preferences was disabled, and once I enabled it, the problem came back.\nI have already generated and submitted the Acrobat Troubleshooting/Adobe Acrobat Diagnostics log to Adobe. I hope this will be fixed soon, but at least I now have a workaround, so I don’t have to reinstall version 2025.001.20577. The workaround is to open and keep the JavaScript Debugger/Console active whenever I want to check for JavaScript errors.\nLike\nD\n1 person likes this\nReply\nAmal.\nCommunity Manager\nForum|Forum|6 months ago\nAugust 12, 2025\nHi there\nHope you are doing well and thanks for sharing the details and the crash report. The exception code 0xc0000005 usually indicates an access violation, which can happen due to corrupt application files, conflicting plug-ins, or issues after an update.\nHere are a few steps you can try to resolve the issue across the affected devices:\n1. Repair Installation\nIn Acrobat, go to Help > Repair Installation. This will replace any missing or corrupted files, including Acrobat.dll.\n2. Disable Third-Party Plug-ins\nOpen Acrobat, go to Edit > Preferences > General and enable Use only certified plug-ins. Restart and check if the issue persists.\n3. Clean Reinstall (for bulk devices)\nUninstall Acrobat completely using the Adobe Acrobat Cleaner Tool\nhttps://adobe.ly/4oxPcZm\nReinstall the latest version from the direct link\nhttps://adobe.ly/4lsqqad;\n4. Check System Conflicts\nEnsure Windows and drivers are updated.\nCheck for any recent security or application changes that may coincide with the crash pattern.\nIf the issue persists after these steps, please collect the Acrobat diagnostic logs, as described here:\nhttps://adobe.ly/3HtN3x6\n, for our development team to investigate further.\n~Amal\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nA\nazarudeen_3601\nAuthor\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|6 months ago\nAugust 14, 2025\nHi Amal ,\nThanks for the update.

causing Adobe Acrobat and Reader to crash when clicking on links that open PDFs in the existing window. The issue can be worked around by opening links in a new window instead.","raw_content":"Reddit - The heart of the internet\nSkip to main content\nGo to Adobe\nr/Adobe\n•\nIronhorsemen\nAdobe acrobat crashing\nHello all! I need help and input. Currently a problem is plaguing mutliple(vast majority if not all) users. Right now it seems if a person clicks on a link to another pdf it crashes. However!! It seems there are like one or two people who aren't having this issue. Out of about 100 people around 80 people are having this issue, as far as we are aware. Both Acrobat Reader and Pro are having this issue. It seems like the last update seems to be the culprit but we have no idea how to proceed. Any help would be awesome!!\nUPDATE 1 - NEW INFO - After some tinkering and playing around. An older thread was found semi related to this issue. It appears that acrobat will crash when clicking the button that links to another pdf.\nThis is specifically when that button/link is used and set for the existing window. So if I click on the button and it opens a new tab with the linked pdf it's fine, but clicking on the link where it's set for the existing window, the pdf crashes. I'll update further later today as I have a meeting set with an Adobe person bout this.\nUPDATE 2 - Follow Up - Alright. Long story short. It's a bug. It's now a known bug because of the update from last week. They have no idea when or how long it'll take to fix. I'm betting though, if enough people send in messages about this being broken, it'll press them to put more people on the issue.\nSo, as of right now, there are two fixes.\nOne is the easier option. Set up your buttons/links to open in a new window. NOT the existing one.\nThe second sucky option, which me and the IT team, are pushing is a program rollback. This program rollback has a few issues. One issue is that you need the specific program update previous to the current one. Program ending in .20470 not the .20533(which is the current one as of this issue). Then ontop of that there needs to be some manual input to block the automatic updates. On top of this you'd need to reach out directly to Adobe to get the older file because every update deletes the older file and it has to be reader or Pro specific.\nIf anyone wants the specifics I'll figure out how to properly convey that info over reddit.\nRead more\nShare\nTop Posts\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of February 15, 2024\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of February 2024\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2024\nReddit Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nUser Agreement\nYour Privacy Choices\nAccessibility\nReddit, Inc. © 2026.

(In the latest update)\nWe're in an unfortunate position of 50/50 staff using the free Adobe DC and Pro. The bug we're getting is exclusive to the free version, so enterprise support is out the window, but we have many people suddenly getting this:\n> Opens a PDF\n> Error:\n\"Cannot find or create the font 'Arial,Bold. Some characters may not display or print correctly.\"\nOnly started to happen in the latest update deployed about a week ago.\nIf you go to \"%appdata%\" and remove all Adobe folders, it resets the application to default and does work, but only for 2 or 3 days.\nTried ripping it out entirely (AppData / ProgramData / ProgramFiles), reinstalled, but the error returns again after a few days.

is experiencing frequent freezing/crashing of Adobe Acrobat Reader 64-bit, which seems to be a common issue.

Do any of you recognised the same problem?

I have for years been using an older version of acrobat that was on my computer from my previous job its been great to edit pdfs. Loved it.  Just got a new PC and had to bite the bullet and get my own  program now.\nFirst off, im not a fan of new layout, but whatever. My main issue is when im editing a PDF its really hard to select individual pieces of the PDF to copy or move or delete. When i try to select something to move the program now groups multiple objects together whereas before I could select them one by one.\nIs this a new setting?

We're sorry for the trouble you had.\nCould you please collect the logs and share them with us for further investigations? The logs will help us identify the root modules causing the issues and enable the product team to work on the fix. See this article to start the Acrobat Diagnostic\nTool\n, and ensure all the log options are selected. Run the log collector tool and attempt to reproduce the issue. After that, close the Log Collector tool; it will generate the logs along with a log ID. Please share this log ID with us for further investigation.\nThanks,\nAnand Sri.\nLike\nReply\nT\nTheScriptDude\nAuthor\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|3 months ago\nNovember 13, 2025\n20251113_adobesysInfo.txt\n20251113_adobesysInfo.txt\n1 reply\nLike\nReply\nS_S\nCommunity Manager\nForum|Forum|3 months ago\nNovember 17, 2025\nHi\n@TheScriptDude\n,\nHope you are doing well.

Sometimes it works, but it is unpredictable. This was not an issue last week. I have updated to the newest version via updates yet it still happens. I paused virus scanning w/o any improvement.\nI also tried to disable enhanded security and protected mode, but that does not seem to help either.\nDo you have any suggestions, this is quite annoying.\nGeneral troubleshooting\nLike\nI\n25 people like this\nReply\nSubscribe\nCorrect answer\njohhnyd68650275\nHi all! In case my experience could help anyone:\nI also got this \"white square\" with \"spinning circle\" which made Adobe Acrobat Reader DC hang/freeze. But, here we are talking about the application beeing published in an on-prem Citrix site, as a \"seamless application\", and also using the 32-bit Norwegian version, running on Windows Server 2019. In addition, it's packaged as an AppV-application, not locally installed. Nevertheless we have been running this setup for quite some time, and only this last week (from after April 1st) the issue has occured.\nWhat seems to fix it in our case is adding the following registry setting via GP Preferences:\nKey: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Adobe\\Acrobat Reader\\DC\\FeatureLockdown\nValue: bWhatsNewExp\nData: 0x1 (DWORD)\nFrom Adobe:\nThis feature was phased in incrementally over 2022. When enabled, the default user on first launch will see a What's New screen as well as a\nSee new features\nnotication. These UI items appear once. Possible values include:\n0: Enable the What's New experience.\n1: Disable.\nSo, after disabling it (= setting the value to 1) the problem disappeared!\ncreative explorer\nCommunity Expert\nForum|Forum|4 months ago\nOctober 3, 2025\n@mels_8\nis there an Adobequestion here?\nm\nLike\nReply\nR\nRachel38744444mgd4\nParticipating Frequently\nForum|Forum|6 months ago\nJuly 31, 2025\neverytime i use acrobat my computer freezes at some point.

Make the change, and don't look back. You've likely wasted enough time and resources trying to fix it or unfreeze your computer. Don't send reports to support; it's a total cluster F. They are slow, and sometimes totally ghost you.

Despite multiple remote sessions with Acrobat support, the problem still persists. They keep attributing the issue to the AutoCAD PDF drawings I'm working on, which I find strange because I have been handling similar PDFs for years, and this issue only started occurring this year. I just finished another remote session today, and unfortunately, the issue remains unresolved. At least the last support agent mentioned that it is a bug and that their engineering team is working on a fix. I hope this gets resolved soon, as it has been affecting my work.\n2 replies\nLike\nReply\nP\nPobrecitojose\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|1 year ago\nNovember 11, 2024\nI have a friend who runs the drawing department for a major world firm (consultant) and told me they switched to Foxit a couple of years ago, and that for CAD, it is perhaps the best application to combine with, much more flexible, robust and compatible.

Did the update finally a few weeks ago and it is horrible. Used fill and sign to fill out a doc. Went to add an image and it all just disappeared... did it three times... figured out if I turned off the \"Enable Auto-adjust layout by default\" it stopped clearing everything I just. But now my image won't get added to the pdf.\nWhy change something that worked so smoothly? Never had any issues with Acrobat until the latest update. Please fix this. I use it on the daily and it's brutally frustrating.\nhelp me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda...\nModern Viewer\nPDF forms\nLike\nA\nJ\nA\n7 people like this\nReply\nSubscribe\nCorrect answer\ntry67\nYou're not alone...

Could you please share more information about whether they disappear while saving or filling out the form? Does this happen only with the new Acrobat UI?\nIt would be helpful if you could share the screen recording of the issue occurring at your end. We will share the information with the team for further investigation.\nThanks,\nMeenakshi\n1 reply\nLike\nT\n1 person likes this\nReply\nJ\njo28074303bogp\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nNovember 28, 2023\nHello, since updating we cannot view our PDF'S (on any project).\nThe pdf's have glitches (flashes on and off in parts).\nWe have uninstalled and reinstalled Acrobat.\nAny other ideas welcome.\nTa.\nLike\nA\n1 person likes this\nReply\nN\nNaseeb28867051fvqh\nParticipant\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nSeptember 6, 2023\nRestore Menu Bar in Adobe Reader | Swtich from New Adobe Acrobat Reader to Old\nhttps://youtu.be/zFkjvUxkSS0\nLike\nReply\ntry67\nCorrect answer\nCommunity Expert\nForum|Forum|2 years ago\nSeptember 5, 2023\nYou're not alone...

But what happens when it suddenly stops working? You might find yourself staring at the screen in frustration, wondering why your reliable tool has betrayed you. It’s not just you; countless users face similar hiccups that can turn a simple task into an uphill battle.\nOne of the most common issues is installation problems. If you've recently updated your operating system or installed new software, it's possible that Acrobat didn’t play nice with these changes. A quick fix could be to uninstall and then reinstall the application—sometimes all it takes is a fresh start.\nAnother frequent culprit behind malfunctioning Adobe Acrobat is corrupted files. Have you ever tried opening a PDF only to see an error message pop up? This can happen if the file was damaged during download or transfer. To remedy this situation, try downloading the document again from its source or check if other PDFs open without issue.\nThen there are compatibility issues to consider. If you're using an older version of Acrobat on newer hardware—or vice versa—you may encounter unexpected glitches. Keeping your software updated ensures smoother operation and access to new features that enhance performance.\nAnd let’s not forget about those pesky settings! Sometimes preferences get altered inadvertently during updates or installations, leading to functionality problems like printing errors or missing tools within the interface itself. Navigating through Preferences > General might reveal options needing adjustment back to their defaults.\nIf none of these solutions work, checking online forums can provide insights from fellow users who’ve faced similar challenges—they often share tips that aren’t covered in official documentation but have proven effective for them.\nIn more serious cases where nothing seems effective—a call to
