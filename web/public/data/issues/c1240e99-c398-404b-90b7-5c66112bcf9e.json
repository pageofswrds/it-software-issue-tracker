Here’s How to Fix It (And Keep Your Sanity)\nOutlook Crashing? Here’s How to Fix It (And Keep Your Sanity)\n4 September, 2024\nAh, the joy of opening Outlook, only to have it crash in your face. If you’re a Microsoft 365 user, you’re probably dealing with corrupted email rules. No worries—we’ve got the fix, and yes, it’s easier than reinstalling Outlook for the tenth time.\nStep 1:\nNuke the Rules\nOutlook’s been hoarding bad email rules like a squirrel with a nut stash. Time to clear it out:\nPress\nWindows + R\n.\nType\noutlook.exe /cleanrules\nand hit Enter.\nThat’ll wipe out all the problematic email rules that have been causing the crashes. Your inbox might feel a little “naked” without them, but at least it won’t keep closing on you.\nStep 2:\nCreate a New Profile\nIf that didn’t work, Outlook might need a fresh start (don’t we all?). Try creating a new profile:\nGo to\nControl Panel\n>\nMail\n>\nShow Profiles\n.\nAdd a new profile and set it as default.\nThis fresh setup could be just the trick to stop Outlook from its spontaneous shutdown routine.\nStep 3:\nUse the Web Version\nStill no luck? You can always bypass the desktop app for now and use\nOutlook Web Access\n. Just pop over to\noutlook.office.com\nand manage your emails like a pro from there. Sure, it’s not the desktop version, but it’s better than a crashing app.\nWhy Reinstalling Outlook Won’t Work\nLook, we all love the ‘turn it off and on again’ approach, but reinstalling Outlook isn’t going to help you here. The problem lies with the email rules, not the app itself, so focus on clearing those out.\nGet Help From the Pros at Equate\nLet’s be honest—if your head’s about to explode from dealing with this, we’re here to help.\nEquate Group\nhas a team of experts who can walk you through this process, or just fix it for you, fast.

This issue is mainly hitting Microsoft 365 users.\nQ: What happens after I clear the rules?\nYou’ll have to manually set up any email rules again, but at least your Outlook won’t keep crashing!\nQ: When will Microsoft actually fix this?\nThere’s no exact timeline, but we expect a solution soon. In the meantime, these steps should keep things running.\nDon’t let tech issues get you down—reach out to\nEquate Group\nfor expert help that’ll have you back on track in no time!\nRelated Articles\nAI\nThe “Deepfake CEO” Scam: Why Voice Cloning Is the New Business Email Compromise (BEC)\nRead More »\n15 February 2026\nCybersecurity\nSecuring the ‘Third Place’ Office: Policy Guidelines for Employees Working from Coffee Shops and Coworking Spaces\nRead More »\n10 February 2026\nAI\nAI’s Hidden Cost: How to Audit Your Microsoft 365 Copilot Usage to Avoid Massive Licensing Waste\nRead More »\n5 February 2026\nAI\nThe “Deepfake CEO” Scam: Why Voice Cloning Is the New Business Email Compromise (BEC)\nRead More »\n15 February 2026\nNo Comments\nCybersecurity\nSecuring the ‘Third Place’ Office: Policy Guidelines for Employees Working from Coffee Shops and Coworking Spaces\nRead More »\n10 February 2026\nNo Comments\nAI\nAI’s Hidden Cost: How to Audit Your Microsoft 365 Copilot Usage to Avoid Massive Licensing Waste\nRead More »\n5 February 2026\nNo Comments\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. We are happy to help you.\nBased on your description, I understand that you're experiencing issues with Outlook crashing repeatedly. This could be caused by a number of factors, such as a corrupted Outlook profile, add-ins, or a conflict with other software on your computer.\nTo troubleshoot this issue, I recommend trying the following steps:\nTry\nopen Outlook in safe mode\nto disable any add-ins that you may have installed in Outlook and see if the issue persists.\nCheck for any available updates for Outlook and install them.\nCreate a new Outlook profile and see if the issue persists, see\nCreate an Outlook profile - Microsoft Support\n.\nRepair an Office application\nusing the Control Panel.\nIf none of the above steps work, you may need to uninstall and reinstall Office.\nIf you're still experiencing issues after trying these steps, please let me know and we can explore other options.\n0 comments\nNo

Outlook 365 has been continually crashing since Wednesday last week and I've yet to find a fix.  Thought I'd post to see if anyone else has been having this or has any ideas.\nHere's what I know:\nSeems to only effect Outlook Classic (but not everyone - some still work).\nAffects Windows 10 and 11 machines\nNot update related (our updates install 10 days after patch Tuesday).\nAffects (at least) versions 2508 Build 19127.20192 (and the build previous to this one) and 2502 Build 18526.20604\nHere's what I've tried:\nOutlook safe mode\nScanPST\nOnline repair install\nFull nuke and reinstall\nChange from current channel to semi-annual enterprise channel\nSFC and DISM repair\nManual Windows updates\nHere's what I think:\nNot network or internet related - not everyone is affected, and we have users at multiple locations with the issue.\nNot group policy, AD permissions, etc, etc related - nothing's changed.\nAny thoughts?

Outlook will also close if you test in Safe Mode,\" the company\nsaid\nin a support document published on Friday.\n\"This issue has been found to occur if the server-based rules for the M365 email account are corrupted or that Outlook cannot process.\"\nOutlook crash (\nJohn211wapiti\n)\nUntil an official fix is released for this issue, Microsoft provides a temporary workaround requiring classic Outlook users to delete all email rules linked to their accounts manually.\nTo do that, you will have to:\nTo remove the client and server rules, run the \"clean rules\" command line by closing Outlook, right-clicking the Windows Start button, selecting Run, and running an 'Outlook.exe /cleanrules' command.\nHold the Shift key when starting Outlook to create a new profile, but only if necessary. On the Profile Picker dialog, click Options, check \"Prompt a profile to be used,\" then click \"New\" and proceed through the prompts (official guidance is available\nhere\n).\nIf you still have the issue, go to\nOutlook Web Access\nand manually remove all the email rules.\n​This week, Redmond also\nshared a workaround\nfor an issue blocking Microsoft 365 customers from signing in or adding Gmail accounts in classic Outlook.\nThree days later, the company also provided a temporary fix for an issue causing Microsoft 365 apps like Outlook, Word, and OneNote to\ncrash while typing or spell-checking a text\n.\nThe future of IT infrastructure is here\nModern IT infrastructure moves faster than manual workflows can handle.\nIn this new Tines guide, learn how your team can reduce hidden manual delays, improve reliability through automated response, and build and scale intelligent workflows on top of tools you already use.\nGet the guide\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft fixes Outlook bug blocking access to encrypted emails\nMicrosoft shares workaround for Outlook freezes after Windows update\nMicrosoft: Windows 11 update causes Outlook freezes for POP users\nMicrosoft: Windows update blocks access to Cloud PC sessions\nMicrosoft: Classic Outlook bug prevents opening encrypted emails\nCrash\nKnown Issue\nMicrosoft 365\nOutlook\nWorkaround\nSergiu Gatlan\nSergiu is a news reporter who has covered the latest cybersecurity and technology developments for over a decade.

The emergency patch fixes issues introduced by the company’s January 2026 security update, particularly affecting apps that interact with files stored in cloud-backed locations such as OneDrive.\nAccording to Microsoft, the bug caused certain applications that “open or save files stored in cloud-backed locations” to stop responding or throw error messages. Outlook was among the hardest hit, especially for users who store PST files in cloud-synced folders. In some cases, Outlook would crash repeatedly, refuse to open, or hang indefinitely, effectively breaking email access for affected systems.\nStory continues below Advertisement\nRemove Ad\nThis marks the second out-of-band update Microsoft has had to issue this year to deal with fallout from the January 2026 Patch Tuesday release. Just last week, the company pushed an emergency fix for separate issues that prevented some Windows 11 devices from shutting down or entering hibernation, while other systems running Windows 10 and Windows 11 were unable to log in using Remote Desktop.\nOut-of-band updates are relatively rare and are typically reserved for serious problems that cannot wait for Microsoft’s regular monthly update cycle. The fact that Microsoft has now issued two such patches in quick succession underlines how disruptive the January update cycle has been.\nThe good news for users is that the latest fix is cumulative. That means installing this update should also include previous emergency fixes related to the January security release, without the need to install multiple patches separately. Microsoft recommends that affected users apply the update as soon as possible to restore normal Outlook behaviour and avoid further instability when working with cloud-stored files.\nRelated Stories\nUsing Windows 11?

While Microsoft continues to emphasise the importance of timely security updates, the repeated need for emergency fixes is likely to raise fresh concerns among IT administrators and everyday users alike about update reliability.\nUsers who rely on Outlook with cloud-based PST files should see improvements after installing the latest out-of-band update. Microsoft has not indicated whether further fixes will be required, but says it will continue monitoring feedback closely.\nInvite your friends and family to sign up for MC Tech 3, our daily newsletter that breaks down the biggest tech and startup stories of the day\nDAILY-EVENING\nSUBSCRIBE\nEnd your day with a breakdown of the biggest tech and startup stories in your inbox\nDAILY-EVENING\nSUBSCRIBE\nEnd your day with a breakdown of the biggest tech and startup stories in your inbox\nSarthak Singh\nSarthak is an experienced writer having covered personal and consumer tech, gadgets news, social media trends, and more for several years\nfirst published: Jan 26, 2026 09:14 am\nDiscover the latest\nBusiness News\n,\nSensex\n, and\nNifty\nupdates.

This second\nemergency patch\naddresses issues seen with Outlook and files stored in the cloud following Microsoft's January 2026 Windows security update.\nAccording to Microsoft, this update fixes a bug where some apps that \"open or save files stored in cloud-backed locations\" became unresponsive or displayed error messages. Some users also experienced Outlook crashing or not opening when PST files are stored in cloud-based options like OneDrive.\nThis is the second time this year that Microsoft had to issue a last-minute fix for bugs related to its January security update.\nLast week\n, some Windows 11 devices couldn't shut down or hibernate, while other devices running Windows 10 or 11 couldn't log in through remote connections. For more context, Microsoft only issues out-of-band updates when there's a serious issue that can't wait until its regular update cycle. Fortunately, the latest out-of-band update is cumulative, so you only need to download and install this one to fix the issues seen with the January update.\nAbout our

I recently updated my system as well. Running Windows 11 Pro. And using Microsoft Office Pro Plus, which I originally bought in APR 2019. I've been running the Microsoft Outlook app (as well as Word, Excel, etc) since then. For some reason Outlook will not open now. I get an error code that reads \"Cannot start Microsoft outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window. The set of folders cannot be opened. The attempt to log on to Microsoft Exchange has failed.\" When I go to the Microsoft downloads page and re-download Office Pro Plus (by entering my product key, all I get is some crummy Microsoft 365 (Office) app which takes me to the internet.\nMy instinct is that you all did a bait-and-switch in order to try to squeeze more money out of your customers. Please tell me I'm wrong. But it seems like for some reason I cannot get the Outlook app back on my laptop unless I become a Premium \"subscriber.\" I'm just a bit confused though because I've literally been using it on my computer for the last 4.5 years.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2023-10-31T14:52:03+00:00\nDear Kennia Lopez,\nThank you for posting in Microsoft Community. It will be a pleasure working with you,\nThe Outlook app is not working properly for you after the update. This seems to be a common issue that many users have reported. There are a few possible solutions that you can try to fix this problem. Here are some suggestions:\nOne possible reason for this issue is that the Outlook app is still running in the background, even though it appears to be closed. You can try to end the Outlook task from the Task Manager and then reopen the app. To do this, right-click Start and select Task Manager. Select Microsoft Outlook, then End task. Check to make sure that new Outlook is closed, then close Task Manager.\nAfter new Outlook closes, reopen the app as you normally would\n.\nAnother possible reason for this issue is that the Outlook app has some corrupted or outdated files that need to be repaired. You can try to run the Office Repair tool to fix any issues with the app. To do this, go to Control Panel > Programs and Features > Microsoft Office 365 > Change. Select Online Repair and then Repair.\nIf none of the above methods work, you may need to reinstall the Outlook app from the Microsoft Store. To do this, go to Start > Settings > Apps > Apps & features. Find Microsoft Outlook and select Uninstall. Then, go to the Microsoft Store and search for Microsoft Outlook.\nDownload and install the app again\n.\nI hope this helps you resolve the issue with the Outlook app.\nTo notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.\nThank you,\nMicrosoft Community\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2023-11-09T09:32:03+00:00\nA similar thing is happening to me. My organization makes us change our passwords every 3 months. After I changed my password on my work computer I then had to update on my cell phone as well as my personal. On both devices I can no longer log-in at all. Both devices only let me type my email in which then it goes into a loading screen that ends up telling me to \"Please check your network settings and try again [2604]\", it doesn't even present a place to use a password.\nOn the computer I use the browser version, not the app(same way I access on my work computer) so there is nothing to reinstall though I have closed everything and restarted the computer.\nMy cell phone is an iPhone and I have removed my account from the app itself and then removed the app from the phone and reinstalled.\nAll I did was change my password so I don't understand why these have just stopped working.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2023-11-03T12:34:20+00:00\nDear Kennia Lopez,\nThank you for your Feedback. you might need to contact your Microsoft 365 Admin to raise\nsupport ticket\n.

I have been using the New Outlook app for a few months now, no issues. This morning I'm unable to open the app at all? I click on the app, and nothing happens. I have never experienced this before. I am able to open the older Outlook app, but cannot access the new app. I have restarted my laptop multiple times and tried to Uninstall the New Outlook but to no avail.\nOn my start page, the New Outlook app has a bar underneath in white but it's not complete? Not sure what that means.\nMicrosoft 365 is also the same.\nIs there a global issue with some MS apps?\nThanks,\nElissa\nOutlook | Windows | New Outlook for Windows | For home\nOutlook | Windows | New Outlook for Windows | For home\nSign in to follow\nLocked Question.\nThis question was migrated from the Microsoft Support Community.

I try to open Outlook and nothing happens for a second, then my desktop icons refresh, then nothing else happens -- Outlook does not open.\nRegarding your questions on clarifications, for me:\nUpdate check: YES - I did a system update (Windows 10) last night and Outlook has NOT worked since then.\nError Messages: None. Just the refresh of desktop icons.\nAccount Access: I signed-on to the web version and it looked fine.\nOther Microsoft Apps: They seem to work fine. I tried OneNote, Excel, Word.\nWhat type of account: IMAP\nSo far, I have tried these troubleshooting steps:\nApp Reset: did not work\nWindows System File Check: corrupt files were found and repaired, but Outlook still did not work.\nMicrosoft 365 Repair: did not work\nI guess since Outlook has not worked since the System Update last night, I will try to revert back.\nThanks,\nJD\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2024-11-15T16:25:48+00:00\n+1 I'm seeing the exact same thing. I tried uninstall and reinstalling the new outlook but same issue. I also had the issue with PowerBI showing continual update and it wouldn't load but repairing it worked. Nothing seems to fix new Outlook. Old outlook works fine.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2024-11-14T11:35:10+00:00\nHello SHAW Elissa,\nGood day!\nThanks for reaching out. Thank you for providing detailed information on the issue you’re experiencing with the New Outlook app on Windows 10 Pro. I understand that you've been using the New Outlook for a few months without problems, but today, it’s completely unresponsive. The app shows a partial loading bar, but it doesn’t open even after a restart and attempting an uninstall.\nThere are a few steps we can take to troubleshoot, but first, let’s try to clarify some details to better understand the situation:\n1. Update Check\n: Do you know if any recent updates were applied to your Windows system or Microsoft 365 apps? Sometimes, certain updates can cause compatibility issues.\n2.\nError Messages\n: When you attempt to open the New Outlook, does any error message appear, or does it remain completely unresponsive with no pop-ups?\n3.\nAccount Access\n: If you're signed in to your Microsoft account within the Classic Outlook app or Web app, does everything load normally there?\n4.\nOther Microsoft Apps\n: Are there any other apps (e.g., Word, Excel) that aren’t responding as expected, or is this mainly affecting Outlook?\nWhat account type are you suing? (eg. Exchange, IMAP, POP 3 etc)\nGiven what you’re describing, this might be due to a background process or a recent update causing the New Outlook app to hang. I will try to provide first line solutions based on your current description and a personal advice on this based on my experieces with issues like these:\nApp Reset\n:\nGo to\nSettings > Apps > Installed apps\n(or\nApps & Features\nin older versions).\nScroll down, locate\nOutlook (New)\n, select\nAdvanced options\n, then click\nReset\n. This will reset the app without affecting your data.\nWindows System File Check\n:\nIt’s possible that some system files are corrupted. Open\nCommand Prompt as Administrator\nand type\nsfc /scannow\nto scan and repair any corrupted system files.\nMicrosoft 365 Repair\n:\nOpen\nControl Panel > Programs > Programs and Features\n, find\nMicrosoft 365\n, and select\nChange\n. Choose\nQuick Repair\nor\nOnline Repair\nto fix any underlying issues.\nClear the Cache\n: Sometimes, clearing the app’s cache can resolve loading issues. You can do this by navigating to\nSettings > System > Storage\n, then selecting\nTemporary files\nand clearing the cache.\nCreate a New Profile\n:\nOpen Control Panel and search for \"Mail.\"\nClick on \"Show Profiles\" and then \"Add\" to create a new profile. Set this new profile as the default and try opening Outlook again.\nIf these itroubleshooting steps do not resolve this issue, try doing a backup and perfrom a system restore to a restore point where it was working normally. This normally resolves this kind of issues based on personal experience.\nPlease understand that our initial response may not always resolve the issue immediately. However, with your help and more detailed information, we can work together to find a solution.\nFeel free to reach out if you need further assistance. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding and thank you for your time and cooperation. Have a great day!\nThank you for being part of the Microsoft Community.\nSincerely,\nMicrosoft Community Moderator\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2024-11-16T10:54:42+00:00\nFirst time for a few days I have been trying to open MS Outlook New this morning and experiencing same problems as above.  However, added to this is that when MS insisted I converted to MS Outlook (new) I have been no longer able to open MS Outlook (classic).  Therefore, cannot now access any of my emails on Outlook via my Windows 10 pc.  HELP!!\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2025-06-03T14:03:04+00:00\nOutlook new is biggest load of **** that microsoft has put out. It basically only works if you use microsoft servers !!\nPOP and IMAP accounts dont work to 3rd party mail servers like smartermail, excim, dovecot, etc. I have tried to track this down to specific issues using a sniffer, but it just doesnt work, auto detect, manual, etc. use thinderbird or the gmail client it works 100% immediately no issues, use outlook classic same it works fine, but lo and behold try new outl;ook and you got endless headaches and it just doesnt work.

If so, Microsoft suggests creating a new FORMS2 folder to fix the problem.\nWhy Is Outlook Crashing On Starting or Opening a New Email\nOn January 7, Microsoft rolled out the version 2412 update for Outlook across all Microsoft 365 Office channels. After downloading the update,\nmany users complained\nthat the email client crashed whenever they tried to reply, forward, read, or even create a new email. The crash was accompanied by the exception code 0x0000005.\nMicrosoft quickly acknowledged the problem and asked affected users to revert to the old version of Outlook as a temporary workaround until they could release a solution in the next update, which was due on January 28. The update was released on schedule and successfully resolved the problem.\nStrangely enough, many users\nstarted facing the same issue\nafter downloading the version 2504 update, which was released for Outlook for Microsoft 365 at the beginning of June. Microsoft has once again\nacknowledged the issue\n, but this time they have also explained the reason behind the crash.\nAccording to Microsoft, the problem is occurring because Outlook is unable to open the Forms Library. The support document also notes that, while the problem affects Outlook on all Microsoft 365 official channels, it is most common on virtual desktop infrastructures.\nRelated\nHow to Create a Distribution List in Outlook\nAvoid the hassle of manually entering each email address.\nPosts\nHow to Fix the Outlook Crashing Issue\nAt the time of writing, Microsoft is still investigating the issue. Until a permanent solution is found, they’ve released a temporary workaround to address the problem. Since the issue is related to the Forms Library, Microsoft has suggested that affected users create a new FORMS2 folder. But before doing so,\nopen Task Manager\n, right-click Outlook and any other Office applications running in the background and select \"End Task.\"\nNext,\nopen the Run dialog box\n, type\n%localappdata%\\Microsoft\n, and press Enter. Right-click on an empty space, hover over \"New\" and select \"Folder.\" Name the folder\nFORMS2\n. If you receive a prompt indicating that the FORMS2 folder already exists, replace the old FORMS2 folder with the new one.\nThat’s it.\nRestart your computer\n, and you should no longer encounter the issue.\nRelated\n6 New Outlook Email Tips and Tricks You Need to Know\nBecome an Outlook pro in no time!\nPosts\nBy\nTony Phillips\nTry These Fixes If You're Still Experiencing the Issue\nThe classic Outlook will most likely stop crashing once you have created the FORMS2 folder. However, if the problem persists, you can try the following solutions.\nDetect and Remove Problematic Add-Ins\nThe classic Outlook client may crash on your computer due to a malicious add-in that you have installed. To catch that add-in, open the Run dialog box, type\noutlook.exe /safe\n, and click \"OK.\" Then, click File > Options > Add-ins.\nChoose \"COM Add-ins\" from the Manage drop-down menu, and click \"Go.\" Uncheck all installed add-ins, and click \"OK.\" Next, restart Outlook and check whether you are still experiencing the crashing issue. If the problem no longer occurs, it confirms that one of the add-ins that you just disabled was causing the issue.\nTo narrow it down, enable each add-in one by one, restarting Outlook after enabling each add-in. You need to repeat this process until you identify the add-in that causes Outlook to crash. Once you find it, remove it from Outlook by selecting it and then clicking the \"Remove\" button.\nRepair the Outlook App\nMicrosoft offers built-in repair functionality for its Office apps that you can use to fix issues with Outlook. To use it,\nopen the Settings app\nand navigate to Apps > Installed apps. Then, click the three dots next to Microsoft 365 Apps and choose \"Modify.\"\nSelect the \"Online Repair\" option, and click \"Repair.\"\nOnce the repair process is complete, restart your device and check if the issue is resolved.\nUpdate Outlook\nAs mentioned earlier, Microsoft is still investigating the issue and will most likely roll out a permanent fix through a future update for Outlook. Therefore, you should regularly check for any available updates for Outlook. To do this, open the Outlook client, click File > Office Account > Update Options > Update Now.\nRelated\nI Switched to New Outlook for Windows so You Didn't Have To\nOh New Outlook, you could have been so great.\nPosts\n15\nBy\nPatrick Campanale\nWith the release of the new Outlook app, Microsoft has begun to shift its focus away from the classic Outlook. To attract more users to the new Outlook, they have added features such as the ability to\nuse it without an Internet connection\nand improved security by blocking file types like \".library-ms\" and \".search-ms.\" This isn't the major bug for \"old\" Outlook recently either.\nHow-To Geek Report: Subscribe and never miss what matters\nUnlock your tech-savvy potential and master the digital world with How-To Geek.\nSubscribe\nBy subscribing, you agree to receive newsletter and marketing emails, and accept our\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.

Please correct me if I am wrong. If that is the case, I recommend using Outlook Web or switching to New Outlook as a temporary workaround.\nIn the meantime, you can try standard troubleshooting steps such as starting Outlook in Safe Mode to check if the crash is caused by add-ins, repairing Office through Control Panel, and recreating your Outlook profile if necessary.\nAdditionally, there have been reports that Classic Outlook crashes when opening or starting a new email. Microsoft has provided a temporary workaround: close Outlook, navigate to\n%localappdata%\\Microsoft\n, create a new folder named\nFORMS2\n, and restart Outlook.\nPlease review the two official Microsoft articles below for detailed instructions:\nOutlook crashes or stops responding when used with Office 365\nClassic Outlook crashes opening or starting a new email\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please provide a screenshot of the error notification via private message. Looking forward to your reply.\nIf the answer is helpful, please click\n\"Accept Answer\"\nand kindly upvote it.

If the Outlook application has started crashing on your iPhone after the latest update, you are not the only one; many more users report similar problems. This behavior is typically due to compatibility issues from the latest version. While Microsoft has not officially confirmed a fix yet, it usually issues hotfixes or patches shortly after the reports go viral.\nIn the meantime, here is a quick workaround:\nForce quit the app and restart your iPhone. This clears temporary memory.\nDelete email, don't save and reinstall Outlook. When you do so, be sure to get the most recent version on the App Store.\nClear browsers cache, and turn off background app refresh for Outlook.\nIf the problem does not improve, you may want to use Safari to use Outlook, or revert to using another mail app for a period of time.\nIf the answer is helpful, please click \"Accept Answer\" and kindly upvote it.

After applying an update to the Microsoft Outlook App for iPhone several days ago, the app will now no longer work, update, etc.  Open it up, it acts like its going to start and then blanks out.  I have deleted the Safari cache, deleted and reloaded the app from the App Store (the icon will load, it just won't launch) and nothing.  There was another update from the app store for Outlook this morning... I thought that might have fixed, but once loaded same issues persist.  Interesting observation - under \"Updated Recently\" in the App store on my phone - even though I did update the Microsoft Outlook app again this morning, it does not show up on this list with other recently updated apps.  FYI, all other apps on my phone work fine.  Any ideas?\n569\n2\n12 replies\nLoading page content\nPage content loaded\nUser profile for user:\n      Robertwo\nRobertwo\nUser level:\nLevel 1\n8 points\nSep 30, 2022 6:04 AM in response to miss163\nHad the same problem after updating last night.\nSettings > iPhone Storage > Outlook > Delete App\nPower Cycle iPhone\nManually Backup iPhone\nSettings > General >Transfer or Reset iPhone > Erase All Content and Settings\nErase everything and restore previous iCloud backup from before the IOS 16 upgrade.\nReinstall Outlook and add back your email accounts, tweak setting back as you want them and wait for data to sync.\n20 mins + Time to download all data and all back working.\nHope it helps.\nReply\nLink\nUser profile for user:\n      Alphabeta101\nAlphabeta101\nUser level:\nLevel 1\n12 points\nOct 2, 2022 12:18 PM in response to Robertwo\nUpdate: my Outlook spontaneously started working again today.

I have Microsoft Outlook Version 1.2024.417.100 (Production).  Client Version is 20240419007.16 .  I also have an Office 365 paid account.\nI am having two major issues that I think are related:\nNew Outlook does not regularly send/receive messages (maybe opnly every few hours) un;ess I close and reopen. I do not see a 'sync' or 'refresh' option in the tool bar or in settings.\nAND\nAbout 50% of my messages do not send and end up in the Draft folder. Generally I have to retype and resend to get them top send.\nAny thoughts or suggestions?\nThank you!\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Install, redeem, activate | For home | Other\nMicrosoft 365 and Office | Install, redeem, activate | For home | Other\nProcesses in Microsoft 365 for setting up Office apps, redeeming product keys, and activating licenses.\nSign in to follow\nLocked Question.\nThis question was migrated from the Microsoft Support Community.

We do not have access to your account.\nI'm sorry you're having trouble with the New Outlook app.\nTry resetting the Outlook app, and check if the issue persists.\nOpen Settings on your PC > Click on Apps.\nUnder the Installed Apps tab, select the Outlook app.\nClick the menu (three-dots) button on the left and choose Advanced options.\nClick the Repair button.\nConfirm if the Outlook client is working and emails are syncing. If it’s still not working, proceed to the next step.\nClick the Reset button.\nAfter completing these steps, the Outlook app’s data will be deleted as if it was recently installed.

Any time I try to send a reply it states that the message no longer exists, I've then had to paste it through a second time to send.\nJust today my search bar stopped working entirely again only in the group, I try to search a specific inventory unit and it just doesn't register. This has basically halted all productivity as I can't search through weeks/months worth of emails. I've tried resetting and reinstalling within Microsoft store with no results.\nI should also mention I'm the only one of 14 members that has this issue.

Microsoft will also fix problems with blank sections appearing in some users’ calendar view, and the bug that makes the “special paste” keyboard shortcut\nCtrl + Alt + V\nnot work.\nFixes for the aforementioned issues will be sent out to beta testers in May and to the public in June,\nBleeping Computer\nreports.\nIn recent months, Microsoft has patched several other bugs in the classic Outlook app, including a problem with the popular keyboard shortcut Ctrl C. Given that the baton has officially been passed to new Outlook, it may be wise to migrate to the fresher version sooner than later.\nFurther reading:\n12 useful tips for the new Microsoft Outlook\nThis article originally appeared on our sister publication\nPC för Alla\nand was translated and localized from Swedish.\nAuthor: Mikael Markander\n, Contributor, PCWorld\nMikael writes news across all our consumer tech categories.

We are glad to assist.\nI understand how frustrating it can be when Outlook isn’t working as expected on your Android devices. Let’s troubleshoot the issues you’re facing step by step:\nNo Emails Showing Up After Refresh:\nSometimes, cached data can cause synchronization issues. To resolve this:\nForce close the Outlook app on both phones.\nClear the app’s cache:\nOn Android 10, go to\nSettings > Apps & notifications > Outlook\n. Tap\nForce stop\n, then tap\nClear Data\nand\nClear Cache\n.\nReopen the Outlook app and sign in again.\nCheck your internet connection to ensure it’s stable.\nUnable to Respond to Emails, Open Attachments, or Forward Emails:\nThese issues might be related to the app itself or your account settings.\nTry the following steps:\nForce close the Outlook app (as mentioned above).\nMake sure you have a stable internet connection.\nIf the problem persists, consider resetting your email account within the Outlook app:\nGo to\nSettings > Apps & notifications > Outlook\n.\nTap\nForce stop\n, then reopen the app.\nSign in to your email account again.\nIf you’re using an IMAP or POP account, consider adding it as an Exchange ActiveSync account instead. This should help with calendar and contact syncing.\nEnsure that the app has the necessary permissions to access your calendar and contacts.\nIf you’re still unable to respond to emails or open attachments, consider reinstalling the Outlook app from the Play Store.\nAdditional Tips:\nIf you’re missing a specific feature in Outlook, you can provide feedback to Microsoft to help prioritize new features in future updates.\nFor Microsoft 365 work or school accounts, reach out to your admin or technical support for further assistance.\nIf your Outlook.com or Microsoft 365 account stopped syncing, follow the steps in the\nMicrosoft Support article\nto troubleshoot the issue.\nRemember to test the app after each step to see if the issue is resolved. If you continue to experience problems, consider reaching out to\nMicrosoft support\nfor personalized assistance.\nI hope this helps let me know if this is contrary to what you need, I would still be helpful to answer more of your questions .\nBest Regards\nCommunity Moderator\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nAnonymous\n2024-05-01T15:36:55+00:00\nHi Amy Langbein,\nGood day.\nThank you for posting to the Microsoft Community. We are glad to assist.\nIt can be frustrating when your\nOutlook tasks\ndon’t behave as expected. Let’s troubleshoot this issue together! Here are a few steps you can take to address the problem:\nCheck Your Time Zone Settings\n:\nEnsure that your\ncomputer’s time zone\nis correctly set. If it’s off, it might cause discrepancies in task due dates.\nTo verify your time zone, go to\nSettings\n>\nTime & Language\n>\nDate & Time\n.\nOutlook Web App (OWA) Check\n:\nAccess your tasks via\nOutlook Web App\n(OWA) to see if the issue persists there.\nSometimes, discrepancies occur only in the desktop client.\nIf the issue is specific to the desktop client, consider creating a new\nOutlook profile\n.\nUpdate Outlook\n:\nMake sure your\nOutlook desktop client\nis up to date.\nIf you’re not on the latest version, update it and see if the issue persists.\nTask Due Date Adjustment\n:\nWhen you create a task and add a due date, the\nStart Date\nmight also impact the due date.\nTo maintain the due date when changing the start date, follow these steps:\nOpen the task in its own window by\ndouble-clicking\non it.\nClick on the\nDate Picker icon\nof the\nDue Date\nfield.\nHold the SHIFT key\nand click on the date you want as the new\nStart Date\n.\nWhen done correctly, the Start Date field will update, and the Due Date field will remain the same.\nVisualize Due Dates\n:\nSometimes, due dates appear incorrectly due to display settings.\nIn\nOutlook 2019\n, you can adjust the\nTask Bar\nto show the\nDue Date\ninstead of the default “Start By” date.\nSimply drag the Task Bar to the left to expand it, revealing columns like Start Date, Due Date, and Reminder

The findings indicate that there is an ongoing service incident affecting multiple tenants, which aligns with the behavior you are experiencing, tracked under Incident ID: EX1220516\nYour Global admin can also review it here:\nService Health - Microsoft 365 admin center\n.\nMicrosoft has acknowledged this issue and the engineers has started recovery efforts began on January 21, 2026. Service availability is steadily improving toward normal levels and will be updated publicly when available.\nAt this stage, no action is required on your part. Once systems are fully restored, Outlook should begin functioning normally again without the need to make changes to your settings or devices. That said, I kindly hope you can remain patient a little longer while the engineering teams continue working hard to fully restore the best possible experience for all users.\nIn the meantime, a temporary workaround is to disable Wi‑Fi, launch the app, and then re‑enable Wi‑Fi. To minimize disruption to your workflow, it is also recommended to access your account through a mobile browser using Outlook on the web, ensuring that urgent communications are not missed.\nAdditionally, you can also click the \"Are you experiencing this issue\" and choose yes. Submitting feedback through that helps the backend teams track the issue more effectively and prioritize it for the impacted organization.\nI hope you find this information helpful.\nShould any additional concerns arise regarding this specific issue, please do not hesitate to reach out.\nThank you for being an integral part of the Microsoft family. Your concerns and business are highly valued.\nIf the answer is helpful, please click \"Accept Answer\" and kindly upvote it.

Issues\nEnsure smooth email delivery by checking Outlook's status, restarting the app, and maintaining stable internet connectivity\nBy\nTricia Goss\nTricia Goss\nWriter\nPima College\nTricia Goss has been a writer and editor for 10+ years. She's written tips and tutorials for Microsoft Office applications and other sites.\nlifewire's editorial guidelines\nUpdated on June 10, 2025\nIn This Article\nView All\nIn This Article\nFixes to Try\nCauses of the Problem\nFrequently Asked Questions\nClose\nThe Download\nMake sure Outlook is working and check your internet connection if you're not getting emails.\nRestart Outlook and see if your messages are in a different folder or on another device.\nUpdate your email password in Outlook, and ensure no one is blocked or working offline.\nIf you were expecting an email that didn't arrive or are missing new messages in Microsoft Outlook, troubleshooting can help identify and fix the problem.\nInstructions apply to all versions of Outlook, including Outlook for Windows and Mac and Outlook.com.\nHow Do I Fix Outlook Not Receiving Emails?\nWhether you're using Outlook on your computer or through\nOutlook.com\n, try these steps one by one. Test the app after each step to see if it resolves the issue.\nCheck if Outlook is down\n. If you're not getting emails on Outlook.com, Microsoft could be having an issue on their end. When this happens, there's really nothing you can do but wait for them to fix it.\nhis step is necessary only if you're using Microsoft's email. If you aren't receiving Gmail messages in Outlook, check if\nGmail is experiencing issues\n.\nRestart Outlook. On occasion, the email client (and other applications) can stop working for seemingly no reason. Closing and re-opening Outlook could be all it takes to clear up any issues that are preventing emails from arriving.\nOutlook often fails to open after being closed. For a solution, refer to our guide:\nWhat to Do When Microsoft Outlook Won't Open\n.\nCheck your internet connection\n. If you see\nDisconnected\n,\nWorking Offline\n, or\nTrying to connect\nstatuses, there may be\nnetwork connectivity issues you can address\n.\nCheck other Outlook folders for messages\n. If new emails aren't in the Inbox, they might be in the Junk Email folder, or you may have deleted them.\nLook for the email on your other devices. Depending on how your server settings are configured, a message you deleted on one device might still exist on another device.\nWhen using an IMAP email account on multiple devices, actions on one device reflect on all. Deleting an email from your phone will also remove it from your computer, and vice versa.\nUpdate your password in Outlook\n. If you changed your email password through your provider's website, you need to update Outlook with that new password before you can download emails.\nHow to Permanently Stop Outlook's Annoying Password Prompts\nAll you're doing in this step is telling Outlook your new email password. You can skip this step if you didn't recently change the password to your email account.\nUnblock their email address\n. By design, you won't receive emails from someone you've blocked.\nUnblocking the sender lets you receive new emails from them. However, old emails sent during the block won't appear; they'll need to resend those.\nSwitch Outlook to work online\n. Outlook can be set to work offline, preventing it from receiving messages. This is indicated by \"Work Offline\" being selected in the Send/Receive tab.\nCreate a new Outlook profile\n. Outlook uses profiles to store information about your email accounts. If your profile is corrupt, it can cause you to stop receiving email.\nClear the Outlook cache\n. This is a common practice when apps behave unexpectedly. Don't worry, this won't delete any emails.\nCheck your email rules\n. If you created a rule to route incoming emails to a different folder or delete them, it makes sense that you can't find those messages. Examining the rule will show where your emails ended up, making it easy to read them.\nEmpty the Deleted Items folder\n. Your inbox might be too full to receive new messages.\nWhile this isn't a common issue, clearing out deleted messages can help. Consult with your email provider to verify if this is the problem.\nHow to Fix Outlook Not Sending Emails\nCause of Outlook Not Receiving Emails\nThere are a few reasons why you may not be receiving new emails. Here are some possible causes:\nMicrosoft's servers are down\nYour internet isn't working correctly\nThe email did arrive, but it's in a different folder\nYour password is outdated\nThe sender is blocked\nOutlook is set to work offline\nThe email profile is corrupt\nFAQ\nHow do you archive emails in Outlook?\nOutlook automatically archives emails by default, but if you want to archive something manually you can.

Users report global login issues\nMicrosoft Outlook users worldwide are facing login and server connection problems, with many reporting a 'something went wrong' error\nTamara Davison\n10 July 2025\nCOMMENTS\nMicrosoft\nOutlook\nusers\nare reporting issues with the platform this morning, with people receiving the notification “something went wrong,” when they try to log in.\nAccording to\nDown Detector\n, hundreds of people have reported issues throughout the morning, with most reporting login and server connection issues.\nIt’s understood that this is a global issue that impacts Microsoft Outlook and Hotmail users around the world on desktop and mobile devices. However, other Microsoft products such as Microsoft 365, Skype and Teams is reportedly operating as normal.\nAccording to a notification shared by a Microsoft user, “users may be unable to access their mailbox using any connection method.”\nMicrosoft’s service update also reads: “We're having issues, but we're working on it.”\nAnother service update from Microsoft then read: “We’ve determined the cause of the issue and have started deployment of a fix. We expect the fix to take an extended period following our safe change management process.”\nTaking to social media, several Microsoft users have expressed their frustration with the platform as well as a lack of information regarding the issue.\nAt the time of writing, the official Microsoft Outlook social media profile hadn’t shared an update regarding the reported technical issues\n“Seems Outlook has been down globally for multiple hours. Can't log in on desktop or web or app. And no word yet from\n@Outlook\nor\n@Microsoft\n. Did you guys fire the social media manager who should be reporting on global outages to keep users informed? Or perhaps haven't trained AI yet on how to do that?” wrote one account.\nAnother wrote: “Came all the way to X to find why Microsoft Email\nhttp://Outlook.com\nService was failing. There was NOTHING there to tell me.”\n“\n#Outlook\nseems to be down this morning — I’m unable to access any emails. Is there any information on when the service will be available again?” wrote a user in Germany.\nRead More\nWhat is Cowork?

I can go into Task Manager and close the Background Process relating to Outlook Classic which allows me to open Outlook Classic again, but this is not ideal as I would rather not do this. Alternatively I can restart my laptop and Outlook Classic will open, but if I close it down it won't re-open unless I either close the Outlook Background Process in Task Manager or restart the laptop.\nThe second issue is that I can send an email and it will be sent to the person I am sending the email to, but it doesn't show as being sent in the Sent Items folder, this is very strange, receiving emails is fine so far.\nI have encountered this using a Yahoo Pop account, so I need some guidance on what I can do to resolve these issues in Outlook Classic?\nIs there a specific fix in Outlook Classic or do I need to uninstall this (KB5074109) (26200.7623) update?\nI can't seem to find a way of uninstalling update (KB5074109) (26200.7623), so may need some guidance here?\nMany Thanks,\nChris\nOutlook | Windows | Classic Outlook for Windows | For home\nOutlook | Windows | Classic Outlook for Windows | For home\nSign in to follow\nLocked Question.\nYou can vote on whether it's helpful, but you can't add comments or replies or follow the question.\n169 comments\nHide comments for this question\nReport a concern\nI have the same question\nI have the same question\n46\n{count} votes\nGabe Bratton\n•\n606\nReputation points\n•\nMicrosoft Employee\n•\nModerator\n2026-01-14T21:23:56.4333333+00:00\nThis issue is fixed with Windows out of band KB\nKB5078127\n.\nWindows guidance,\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-25h2#2738msg\nOutlook guidance,\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/classic-outlook-profiles-with-pop-accounts-and-psts-hang-after-windows-updates-on-january-13-2026-590fe356-ecc2-49f4-b9e3-bd39fafa58f6\n2 votes\nReport a concern\nBigbruva\n•\n155\nReputation points\n2026-01-15T00:10:13.1533333+00:00\nI am seeing the same issue following this security update and we are only using POP/SMTP accounts no IMAP.

I also mentioned that my wife also uses the same laptop with her own Microsoft Account and her Outlook Classic was working ok, we both use POP accounts, I have Yahoo POP and she has Gmail POP, the repair guy said that Microsoft may have tested Outlook and Gmail accounts which were fine and not bothered to test for Yahoo POP accounts hence my issue.\nHis suggestion to me was to do a System Restore, which I have carried out for no cost this morning, the restore point had been automatically been set on 13th January before the 2026-01 Security Update (KB5074109) (26200.7623) had been done, so I am now back to having a setup before Tuesdays Windows Update and I have also paused the Windows Update so 2026-01 Security Update (KB5074109) (26200.7623) doesn't re-install for the time being.\nThe outcome is that Outlook Classic opens pulls email through and closes properly as the restore has rolled back 2026-01 Security Update (KB5074109) (26200.7623).\nI did have to repair and reinstall a couple of apps, notably OneDrive, but that is working ok now.\nTo access System restore:\nGo to Start and type restore\nSelect \"Create a restore point\"\nSystem Properties window opens > select System Restore\nFollow the prompts to select time stamped restore point\nConfirm you want to restore using selected restore point\nLaptop reboots and restores, ensure laptop is plugged in as it takes about 30 mins to do\nI will be monitoring Outlook Classic to see if it keeps working and fingers crossed Microsoft sort out this issue before the next Windows Update next month.\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nJohn W\n•\n315\nReputation points\n2026-01-15T14:03:18.98+00:00\nSo some users don't have the update listed at the bottom of Windows Update -> Update History -> Uninstall Updates?\nIt was listed there for me and I was able to uninstall it without issue.\n3 votes\nReport a concern\nJim Cofer\n•\n25\nReputation points\n2026-01-15T16:42:37.93+00:00\nI had the same issue: Outlook Classic 64-bit started hanging\\freezing on Tuesday after installing KB5074109. I tried every obvious fix: M365 Quick Repair, M365 Online Repair, the PST repair tool (which errored out), a new Outlook profile... nothing seemed to help other than uninstalling KB5074109. I'm coming up on 24 hours without KB5074109 and no Outlook issues.\nNote that the same Outlook install also had a work profile to a M365 server, and that had no issues.\n3 votes\nReport a concern\nJim Cofer\n•\n25\nReputation points\n2026-01-15T16:45:31.8666667+00:00\nPS - if you try uninstalling KB5074109 and get an error message, uninstall Windows Sandbox THEN try uninstalling the update.

If classic MS Outlook is closed, it will not reopen.  When forcing a Restart, Outlook is a task that will not close automatically.   Forcing Outlook to close in the Task Manager works, but all changes made in Outlook are forgotten, it opens up and repops all messages. Very frustrating!!!!!!!!!!\n5 votes\nReport a concern\nGabe Bratton\n•\n606\nReputation points\n•\nMicrosoft Employee\n•\nModerator\n2026-01-15T18:08:09.93+00:00\nEditing to note that pausing OneDrive, disabling OneDrive, unlinking OneDrive did not mitigate the issue.

Gabe,  Sorry, I saw your note too late to attempt it but it feels like, as you said, Outlook was not closing correctly as it was a very persistent task when doing a reboot (ie it would not close).\n5 votes\nReport a concern\nGFL4\n•\n75\nReputation points\n2026-01-15T21:46:14.8666667+00:00\nI have the same problem.  Plus every time I open outlook it redownloads all my emails.  I can only send simple emails with no attachments, no forward, no reply and no manual send/receive.  Only closes normally when there is a hang and I indicate to not wait for outlook to respond.  Otherwise need to end process in task manager.  This is for classic outlook 2024.  Also no way to undo KB5074109 in update history.  Queried chatgpt and advice is to wait for the fix.  Use webmail for heavy tasks.  Also advice is not to leave outlook running if not in use because of corruption risk of PST files.  But the more users that complain, the more likely Microsoft will address.\n2 votes\nReport a concern\nGFL4\n•\n75\nReputation points\n2026-01-15T21:55:38.2333333+00:00\nIt looks like this has been flagged on Microsoft known issues page.

After installing the Windows security update KB5074109 (January 2026), Outlook Classic began to hang and would not properly close profiles, which prevented reopening and caused lingering processes in the background. Additionally, emails marked for deletion would not sync properly, and emails reappeared upon reopening Outlook.\nTo mitigate the issue, I uninstalled the KB5074109 update, which resolved the Hang and sync problems, allowing Outlook to function normally again. I also paused Windows updates for two weeks while awaiting an official fix from Microsoft, as suggested by support threads and community discussions.\nWe are eager to see if Microsoft releases an update to resolve these issues while maintaining device security up to date. Looking forward to hearing about the next update, and I would be very interested in hearing about any other workarounds or solutions that others have found.\nThanks!\n2 votes\nReport a concern\nSusan Belmonte\n•\n0\nReputation points\n2026-01-16T22:09:11.8533333+00:00\nExperiencing identical problem.

I know it worked for others and it even worked for me for a short time (minutes!) One objective is why others stay recovered yet me and many do not. I looked into the OneDrive thing (as a contributing factor to those still adrift) at first I thought (and reported) it OFF/gone but turns out it has a mind of its own and sneaks back on and tries to synchronize and more and may indeed may still be an explanatory contributing factor. I also have large volume of saved messages (files in search folders) I use as archive and searching them (and indexing to assist that) has always been a bit kludgy or problematic for me. That could explain differences in resolution for some as well. In fact, a coordinated test (with GROK) shows I endtask many things suspected of being involved and launch Outlook via Profile Selection always in SAFE mode now (where less havoc generally occurs)...and i can select Inbox, open and view a New message, hit reply, enter some text (If i say YES to show pics it FREEZES on SEND in all modes!) and SEND = ALL OK.  I can go to FILE pulldown to EXIT (or go to options....) and all is well as long as I do it quickly. If i wait a minute or 2 just choosing FILE it freezes and stalls (but not if I do it sooner) and requires aborting Outlook for recovery. Coordinated tests involve watching what pops up in Task Manager, as I wait/IDLE, and the pop-up that appears to generate this particular issue is WINDOWS SEARCH INDEXER... after about a minute it comes on EVEN THOUGH I have UNCHECKED OUTLOOK from the Index Searching Dialog! (for all my recent tests.) Once he appears FILE and other tasks will hang and freeze or misbehave! It would be nice if MS techs read this (thread/etc) or advanced users that could absorb and communicate the effects (of my testing or outcomes) to folks in a position to resolve. The MS Tech that removed KB give me a ticket to follow-up but when i finally reached someone (with great diffculty) to report Oh sorry it was only fixed/resolved for a couple of minutes then NO... 3 days ago she says yeah we are working on it go check the updates... sent me an email with a link to an internal site that aborted when i tried.

This confirms our suspicion—the delay allows the indexer to activate (even with Outlook unchecked in Indexing Options), and it conflicts with UI actions like menu access by probing your large PST archives in the background. The quick test pre-wait worked because it happened before the resurfacing; the idle buildup triggers the stall. This is a common post-KB5074109 residual (Microsoft's investigation updated January 15, 2026, still ongoing—no full patch yet), where indexing resumes asynchronously on idle, amplifying hangs in setups with massive email volumes like yours.\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nBernadette M\n•\n0\nReputation points\n2026-01-18T08:12:02.1633333+00:00\nHad the same problem.

For me (and an MS Tech remotely accessing) classic removal failed and failed and they did DISM... which likely did not UNDO EVERYTHING. Unfortunately the MS Tech also permanently removed earlier restore points in their efforts for me. It also seems to matter what Outlook activity (tasks, syncs, etc) went on while bad stuff (culprits) was still there. So Joe may be ok but Susie not OK, now, as we see: lingering secondary damage (profile/PST corruption or incomplete SSU rollback) rather than the kernel APIs still being broken.

While not fast (indexing still off) not one freeze or mishap or error yet besides things like duplicate or missing emails from the NEW BUILD process inadequacies. You may recall KB5 could not be uninstalled fully on my setup so the LCU (partially at least i guess) was removed via DISM yet problems still persisted, even with other fixes and specials. I have asked GROK to corroborate and explain along the way, and asked for something to share with affected users that may help them (at least understand) Here it is: ->\nUpdate on KB5074109 (KB5) Outlook POP3 Mayhem: After multiple MS tech sessions involving failed uninstall attempts from Update History (error 0x800f08xx series) and partial DISM removals (likely just the LCU, leaving SSU intact), my system still showed KB5 in history but with lingering freezes during Outlook repairs/exports. The breakthrough came from creating a fresh Outlook profile: Tech set it up cleanly with my ISP's POP3 settings, then we tediously exported/imported archives from the old corrupted profile (ignoring interim hangs). No clean backups meant some duplicates and unexpected undeletes from the server, but after a full day of medium testing in the new profile—no freezes at all, even with indexing disabled and OneDrive misbehaving. This suggests KB5 often corrupts the existing profile/PST infrastructure beyond reliable repair (ScanPST or /Repair fall short), but building a new one from scratch bypasses it effectively, importing data piecemeal without reintroducing issues.What it means for remediation: Partial DISM LCU removal might not fully revert KB5's damage (history lags, remnants persist), explaining why some full uninstalls via Settings recover better—though security risks make waiting for MS's patch wiser.

I just wanted to mention that I chatted with a person from MS Support yesterday, and he assured me that uninstalling KB5074109 and pausing automatic updates temporarily would not be dangerous for my pc--something that the \"uninstalling option\" warns against, and which filled a non-expert with me with great anxiety. This was therefore such a relief to hear. He said that if I'd been updating windows regularly (through automatic updates) and also had anti-virus software (I have Trend Micro), I should be fine until a fix was announced by MS.\nI hate having to wait for a new security update that will fix this Outlook Classic problem, but at least a lot of the fear (that I was exposing my pc to danger) has gone away.

I have avoided letting WINDOWS install it for now - but WINDOWS keeps FORCING the installation!   I had updates on hold and was shutting down without the updates.   I kept delaying the installation of that particular update, but it overrode me and did it anyway.\nI have tried the \"NEW\" Outlook - but all my files and history are in Classic.   I can't arrange the e-mail accounts the way I want to on that platform, and it won't accept / show the signatures I created for each e-mail address in the new platform.

I had the same issue. Outlook was buggy all of the 15th and on closing wouldn't re-open unless I did a PC restart. It developed today (Friday) into not showing sent emails since the 15th, refusing to delete everything that had been deleted from 11.30GMT on the 15th and ultimately not sending any emails, including a proposal. My wife (more non-tech than me) suggested updates and on searching the system on the PC I uninstalled KB6074109. PC automatically re-started, did some sort of restore and bingo it works!!!

I uninstalled KB5074109 and now Outllook works fine again.  No repairs or fixes listed worked except uninstalling the security update.  I had to postpone updates to keep it from reinstalling.  It's the only way I could make Outlook work.  The security update KB5074109 is the culprit.  I am running Windows 11.\n11 comments\nShow comments for this answer\nReport a concern\nRicardo Milton Cunha\n•\n0\nReputation points\n2026-01-16T15:39:07.27+00:00\nExactly same here and after uninstall that security update, Outlook was back working normally as always!\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nChris Hadley\n•\n10\nReputation points\n2026-01-16T17:23:27.43+00:00\nMike, you are not alone on this.

It's essential to have email. It is for most of us the MAIN reason for using a computer. I will remain without the defective update until it is fixed and working with Outlook Classic no matter what. Like thousands (or is it millions?) I am waiting for Microsoft engineers to come back with a fix and give us a fully functional product.\n2 votes\nReport a concern\nSteve Rymell\n•\n0\nReputation points\n2026-01-21T23:25:06.76+00:00\nuninstalled the update after my Outlook kept freezing up.\nThis resolved the problem until the update was downloaded again so now i need to uninstall and stop automatic patching.\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nDeleted\nThis comment has been deleted due to a violation of our Code of Conduct.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve these issues:\nCheck for Additional Updates\n: Ensure that you have installed all available updates for Outlook and Windows. Sometimes subsequent updates can fix issues introduced by previous ones.\nRepair Outlook\n: You can try repairing your Office installation. To do this, go to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features, select Microsoft Office, and then choose the Repair option.\nDisable Add-ins\n: Sometimes, add-ins can cause Outlook to behave unexpectedly. You can start Outlook in safe mode (hold down the\nCtrl\nkey while starting Outlook) to see if it opens without issues. If it does, consider disabling add-ins one by one to identify the culprit.\nCheck Email Account Settings\n: Since you mentioned using a Yahoo POP account, ensure that your account settings are correctly configured. Verify that the settings for saving sent items are enabled in your account configuration.\nUninstall the Update\n: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you may consider uninstalling the update. To do this, go to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features, select View installed updates, find the KB5074109 update, and choose to uninstall it.\nContact Support\n: If the problem persists, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for further assistance, especially if the issues are directly related to the update.\nThese steps should help you troubleshoot the problems with Outlook Classic. If you need more specific guidance on any of the steps, feel free to ask!\nReferences:\nOutlook not responding error or Outlook freezes when you open a file or send mail\n13 comments\nShow comments for this answer\nReport a concern\nChris Seagrave\n•\n345\nReputation points\n2026-01-14T20:17:20.3233333+00:00\nTried points 1 to 4 and they didn't solve the issue.

Go to the Windows Start button, Search, and type Event Viewer and open it.  Click Windows Logs, Application Log.  Look for Event 1000 for Outlook and if you find one find the corresponding Event 1001 Windows Error Reporting and share that event.  If you only find Event 1000 please share that.  If you don't find either of those see if you find any hang events and share those.  Sometimes there are not exact matching events but if there are it could help assess the issue.

Point 6 went to my local Computer repair shop and they advised I do a System Restore from before the 2026-01 Security Update (KB5074109) (26200.7623) was installed, which has worked so far.\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nTony\n•\n0\nReputation points\n2026-01-15T12:12:56.2133333+00:00\nI Uninstalled the update KB5074109 and after that my problems are gone.\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nDave\n•\n0\nReputation points\n2026-01-18T11:46:12.4833333+00:00\nIt looks like the new update January 17-18 fixed issue\n0 votes\nReport a concern\nHornblower409\n•\n5,295\nReputation points\n2026-01-18T13:54:54.6166667+00:00\n@Dave\nsaid\nIt looks like the new update January 17-18 fixed issue\nIf I do \"Check for Updates\", I do not see any additional major updates after January 13 KB5074109.\nI also do not see any update to the Support Article on this issue since January 15.

I went back and noticed that the sort of updates available to uninstall was the oldest at the top and the newest at the bottom ... then I scrolled and there was the offending KB5074109 at the BOTTOM of the list. Uninstalled it, the system went black on reboot (a known issue} rebooted again after waiting 10 or so minutes and Windows started and Outlook performed as though nothing happened.\n1 vote\nReport a

In enterprise environments, these files are commonly used to access mail when offline and back up important messages.\n\"After installing Windows updates released on or after January 13, 2026 (the Originating KBs listed above), some applications might become unresponsive or experience unexpected errors when opening files from or saving files to cloud-backed storage, such as OneDrive or Dropbox,\" explains Microsoft.\n\"For example, in some configurations of Outlook that store PST files on OneDrive, Outlook might become unresponsive and fail to reopen unless its process is terminated in Task Manager, or the system is restarted.\"\n\"In addition, sent emails might not appear in the Sent Items folder, and previously downloaded emails might be downloaded again. The affected Outlook configurations primarily involve classic Outlook, which is commonly tied to enterprise licensing and is not included with most home installations of Windows. To check your Outlook configuration, see Feature comparison between new Outlook and classic Outlook.\"\nMicrosoft releases OOB updates\nTo address this Outlook problem, Microsoft released the following out-of-band updates today:\nWindows 11 25H2 and 24H2:\nKB5078127\n[\nDownload Link\n]\nWindows 11 23H2:\nKB5078132\n[\nDownload Link\n]\nWindows 10 23H2 and 22H2:\nKB5078129\n[\nDownload Link\n]\nWindows Server 2022:\nKB5078136\n[\nDownload Link\n]\nWindows Server 2025:\nKB5078135\n[\nDownload Link\n]\nWindows Server 2019:\nKB5078131\n[\nDownload Link\n]\nFor those affected by this issue, you can install the updates via Windows Update or the Microsoft Download Catalog using the links above.\nLast Saturday,\nMicrosoft also released OOB updates\nfor bugs that prevented access to Microsoft 365 Cloud PC sessions and prevented some PCs with Secure Launch enabled from shutting down or entering hibernation.\nWhile previous OOB updates could only be installed manually via the Microsoft Download Catalog, Microsoft says those fixes are now also included in today's updates.\nIf these issues do not affect your devices, there is no need to install the out-of-band updates.\nInstead, admins and users can wait for the upcoming preview update or next month's Patch Tuesday, when the fixes will be rolled out as part of the regular update schedule.\nThe future of IT infrastructure is here\nModern IT infrastructure moves faster than manual workflows can handle.\nIn this new Tines guide, learn how your team can reduce hidden manual delays, improve reliability through automated response, and build and scale intelligent workflows on top of tools you already use.\nGet the guide\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft shares workaround for Outlook freezes after Windows update\nMicrosoft fixes bug that blocked Google Chrome from launching\nMicrosoft: January update shutdown bug affects more Windows PCs\nMicrosoft to disable NTLM by default in future Windows releases\nMicrosoft releases OOB Windows updates to fix shutdown, Cloud PC bugs\nEmergency Update\nMicrosoft\nOOB\nOutlook\nPST\nWindows 10\nWindows 11\nWindows Server\nLawrence Abrams\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.

to malfunction on Windows and Mac computers\nBy\nTricia Goss\nTricia Goss\nWriter\nPima College\nTricia Goss has been a writer and editor for 10+ years. She's written tips and tutorials for Microsoft Office applications and other sites.\nlifewire's editorial guidelines\nUpdated on June 2, 2025\nReviewed by\nRyan Perian\nReviewed by\nRyan Perian\nWestern Governors University\nRyan Perian is a certified IT specialist who holds numerous IT certifications and has 12+ years' experience working in the IT industry support and management positions.\nlifewire's editorial guidelines\nIn This Article\nView All\nIn This Article\nThe Causes\nFixes for Windows\nFixes for Mac\nClose\nThe Download\nRestarting your computer can sometimes fix Outlook if it won't open.\nDisabling add-ins can help if Outlook opens in Safe Mode but not in normal mode.\nIf Outlook still won't open, you're probably going to need to update Windows or scan for malware.\nIf you're trying to open Microsoft Outlook from your Start menu or a shortcut icon but it just won't launch, don't worry, there are a few things you can try to get it up and running again. Here are some common fixes that should work when Outlook doesn't open, whether you're using Windows or a Mac.\nReasons Why You Can't Start Outlook\nSeveral problems could cause Outlook not to open correctly or at all. Some common issues include:\nProblematic add-ins\nDamaged files\nA corrupted profile\nNavigation pane issues\nThere are other issues, too, that can contribute. Maybe you've added a new program to your computer that doesn't get along with Outlook, or your system has a virus. Regardless of the specific cause, there are several key troubleshooting fixes to try that might help.\nIf Outlook opens and you see the menus, but your email is unusable, check out our guides on fixing it when\nOutlook keeps asking for your password\nor when\nOutlook won't download your emails\n.\nHow to Fix Outlook Not Opening in Windows\nTry these troubleshooting steps in the order presented here, from simple to more complicated.\nIf you use the cloud-based Microsoft 365 on a PC or Mac, the automated\nSupport and Recovery Assistant\ntool can diagnose and fix many issues, including Microsoft Outlook not starting.\nRestart your computer\n. This is a very basic troubleshooting step but you'd be surprised how often it works for issues like this one.\nOpen Outlook in Safe Mode\n. If the program opens as expected in Safe Mode, the reason it won't open normally is likely due to one or more add-ins.\nFollow these steps to disable add-ins:\nGo to\nFile\n>\nGet Add-ins\n.\nSelect\nMy Add-ins\n.\nChoose an add-in.\nRight-click the add-in and select\nRemove\n.\nIf that doesn't work (every Outlook version is a little different), try these steps:\nSelect\nFile\n>\nOptions\n>\nAdd-ins\n.\nIn the\nManage\nsection, select\nGo\n.\nClear the check boxes next to the add-ins you want to disable.\nSelect\nOK\n.\nCheck Windows for updates\n. Although this might seem unrelated, a pending Windows Update might be the exact solution needed to make Outlook open again.\nScan your computer for malware\n. If you find a problem, resolve it with your security software, reboot your computer, and try to start Outlook again.\nRepair Outlook. If the application is damaged, use the built-in Microsoft 365 repair tool to fix it.\nClose all Office applications.\nOpen Control Panel\n.\nSearch for and select\nUninstall a program\n.\nRight-click\nMicrosoft 365\nand choose\nChange\n.\nSelect\nOnline Repair\nor\nQuick Repair\n.\nRestart Outlook after the process completes.\nRepair your Outlook profile. Outlook profiles can become corrupted, causing all sorts of problems, including Outlook not opening.\nSelect\nFile\n>\nAccount Settings\n>\nAccount Settings\n.\nGo to the\nEmail\ntab and select your profile from the list.\nChoose\nRepair\n(this option isn't available for Outlook Exchange accounts).\nFollow the prompts to complete the wizard and then restart Outlook.\nAs you can tell, this step is only useful if your problem is sporadic. If you can't open Outlook to complete this step, move on to the next option below.\nRepair your Outlook data files. If Outlook still doesn't open, use the Inbox Repair tool to find and possibly fix the problem.\nSearch your computer for\nScanpst.exe\n(the Inbox Repair tool).\nMicrosoft explains\nwhich folder on your computer holds this file.\nSelect\nBrowse\n, navigate to your personal folders (.pst) file, choose the file, then select\nStart\n.\nSelect\nRepair\nif the scan finds errors.\nWhen the repair is complete, restart Outlook.\nThis only works in Outlook 2016 and older. If you're not sure which version you have, go ahead and try these steps.\nReset the navigation pane. A startup issue with the navigation pane can prevent some versions of Outlook from opening correctly.\nYou can do this through the Run dialog box. Open Run via\nWin\n+\nR\n, and then execute this command:\noutlook.exe /resetnavpane\nHow to Fix Outlook Not Opening in Mac\nThese troubleshooting techniques apply to Outlook 2016 and 2011 for Mac.\nRestart your Mac\n. Turning your computer off and then on again will flush Outlook from the memory, which is helpful if it won't open because it's hanging in the background.\nIf Outlook opens intermittently, seize the opportunity to check for updates via\nHelp\n>\nCheck for updates\n. A recent update could include a fix for the problem. Install any available updates you see.\nRebuild the Outlook database. Using the Microsoft utility to rebuild a corrupted database might solve the problem of Outlook not opening on a Mac.\nIf you have a Microsoft Exchange account, rebuilding the database deletes any information that isn't synced with the server. Back up any Outlook data stored only on your computer before you rebuild the database.\nExit all Office applications.\nPress the\nOption\nkey and select the\nOutlook\nicon in the Dock to open the Microsoft Database Utility. It's also available here:\n/Applications/Microsoft Office [version]/Office/\n.\nSelect the identity of the database you want to rebuild.\nChoose\nRebuild\n.\nWhen the process is complete, restart Outlook.\nWas this page helpful?\nThanks for letting us know!\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\nSubscribe\nTell us why!\nOther\nNot enough details\nHard to understand\nMore from Lifewire\nRecover Your Missing Outlook Folders: Step-by-Step Guide\nUse Logging to Troubleshoot Email Problems in Outlook\nTroubleshoot and Resolve Outlook Email Receiving Issues\nHow to Undelete a Message Quickly in Outlook\nHow to Fix It When Outlook Spell Check Is Not Working\nHow to Fix Outlook Search When It's Not Working\nHow to Fix Outlook Not Sending Emails\nHow to Permanently Stop Outlook's Annoying Password Prompts\nHow to Make Unresponsive Hyperlinks Work In Outlook\nHow to Print Email from Outlook or Outlook.com\nTroubleshooting Missing Attachments in Outlook: A Step-by-Step Guide\nUnlock the Power of the Outlook Ribbon: A Step-by-Step Guide\nHow to Move Emails to Folders with One Click in Outlook\nCan't Get Into Outlook?

Sorry to hear that you're having issue with Microsoft Outlook. Let me help you out.\nBased on the description of the issue, Outlook crashes immediately upon launch on MacOS, showing a compatibility error message despite both Outlook and macOS being updated to their latest versions.\nCan you confirm the exact macOS and Outlook version numbers you're running and whether Outlook crashes immediately on launch or only after signing in?\nThe Outlook crash on Mac is a known issue following recent macOS updates, particularly Sequoia 15.0. Microsoft and user reports indicate that updating to macOS 15.1 and Outlook version 16.91 (or later) resolves the launch crash. If you're already on the latest versions, you may need to reset Outlook's preferences or rebuild its database to fix the problem.\nHere are step-by-step Outlook Fixes for Mac:\nVerify Versions\nmacOS: Make sure you are running macOS Sequoia 15.1 or later.\nOutlook: Confirm that Outlook is version 16.91 or newer.\nCheck by opening Outlook > About Outlook.\nReset Outlook Preferences\nFully quit Outlook.\nOpen Finder and go to:     ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Outlook.plist\nDelete this file (it will be recreated when Outlook restarts).\nRelaunch Outlook.\nClear Outlook Cache\nNavigate to:     ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Outlook\nMove this folder to the Trash (do not empty Trash until Outlook has relaunched successfully).\nRebuild Outlook Database\nHold Option while launching Outlook.\nIn the Microsoft Database Utility, select Rebuild Database.\nReinstall Outlook\nCompletely uninstall Outlook (drag the app to Trash and remove remaining files from ~/Library).\nReinstall from the Microsoft 365 portal or Mac App Store.\nUpdate Office Apps\nOpen Microsoft AutoUpdate (search vis Spotlight)\nClick Check for Updates to ensure all Office apps are fully updated.\nWhen addressing Outlook issues, several risks and considerations should be kept in mind. First, ensure data safety by backing up important items such as emails and drafts before deleting caches or resetting preferences. Second, be aware that resetting preferences may necessitate re-entering your account credentials. Finally, if crashes continue even after applying updates, the problem could be due to a temporary macOS bug that may require a future patch to resolve.\nI hope this helps. If you need further assistance you can reply to this message.\nThank you,\nApril P.\nIndependent Advisor\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nSign in to comment\nAdd comment\nQ&A Assist\n2025-12-28T17:29:08.6566667+00:00\nAI generated content.\nThis question contains an answer created with AI from Q&A Assist.\nLearn more\nIf Outlook is crashing upon opening and you are receiving a message about compatibility with your version of macOS, it may be due to the application being moved or duplicated. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:\nCheck the Program Path\n: Ensure that the Outlook application is located in the correct directory. The path should be:\nMacintosh HD\\Applications\\Microsoft Office 2011\n(or the appropriate version you are using).\n     If the path is different, you may need to move the application folder back to its correct location.\nDelete Duplicate Entries\n: Search for duplicate instances of the Outlook application. If you find duplicates, remove them and empty the Trash.\nReinstall Office\n: If the problem persists, consider removing and reinstalling the Office application.

To see if more information about the problem is available, check the problem history in the Security and Maintenance control panel.\nProcess ID: 87d0\nStart Time: 01dbb564fdadc6ce\nTermination Time: 41\nApplication Path: C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\OUTLOOK.EXE\nReport Id: 4bf19126-1517-4c6f-9ca1-51dce8f019bf\nFaulting package full name:\nFaulting package-relative application ID:\nHang type: Unknown\nWe have an on premise MS Exchange Server 2019.  We did not apply an Exchange cumulative updates in this patch cycle.  The error is occuring when we run Outlook in safe mode.  We have rolled back the Office 365 updates on a couple of machines and that has had no impact.  We are considering rolling back both 2025-04 Cumulative updates on select Citrix VDI deployments (Server 2019) and our Windows 10 deployments.\nHas anyone seen this as well with this months updates.\nThe only other change to the Exchange Server was a certificate update for IIS.

Cannot open the Outlook Window”\nApplies To\nOutlook for Microsoft 365\nOutlook 2024\nOutlook 2021\nOutlook 2019\nOutlook 2016\nMicrosoft Office\nGuided support can provide digital solutions for Microsoft 365 problems\nTry guided support\nAre you having trouble starting Outlook or receiving \"Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window\" error messages? We can fix the problem for you, or you can use the troubleshooting steps we're providing below to help resolve these startup issues.\nAre you a Microsoft 365 for business customer? Let us fix the problem for you\nUse the classic Outlook startup troubleshooter to diagnose and fix several common classic Outlook for Windows issues for you.\nSelect the button below to start the classic Outlook startup troubleshooter.\nStart\nClick\nOpen\nif you get a pop-up window indicating\nThis site is trying to open Get Help\n.\nFollow the prompts in the Get Help window.\nImportant:\nYou need to be on Windows 10 or higher to run the troubleshooter.\nYou need to be on the same Windows PC as classic Outlook to run the troubleshooter.\nIf the troubleshooter can't fix your issue, or if you'd like to fix it yourself, see the next section.\nStart Outlook in safe mode and disable add-ins\nSometimes add-ins can conflict with Outlook. Starting Outlook in safe mode, which starts Outlook without add-ins loaded, can tell you if an add-in is the source of the problem.\nNote:\nIf you enabled an ABBYY FineReader add-in, an outdated version of the software might cause an Outlook startup error. For more information, see\nMicrosoft 365 programs may crash with the FineReader add-in installed\n.\nStart Outlook in safe mode\nPress the Windows key + R to open the Windows\nRun\ndialog. (It will likely appear near the lower left of your screen.)\nIn the\nOpen\nbox, type\nOutlook /safe\n, then choose\nOK\n.\nIn the\nChoose Profiles\ndialog box, accept the default setting of Outlook and choose\nOK\n.\nIf prompted, enter your\npassword\nand choose\nAccept\n.\nTips:\nHow do you know you're working in safe mode? You'll see a label similar to the one below at the top of the screen.\nThe Outlook\nicon on your taskbar includes an exclamation symbol to alert you the program isn't operating normally.\nIf Outlook is able to start in safe mode, then the problem is likely with one of your add-ins. You'll need to disable all of your add-ins before restarting Outlook, as described in the following procedures:\nIf Outlook is NOT able to start in safe mode, then try the next proposed solution below, entitled\nCreate a new Outlook profile\n.\nDisable add-ins\nIn the upper-left corner of Outlook, choose\nFile\n>\nOptions\n>\nAdd-ins\n.\nAt the bottom of the\nView and manage Office Add-ins\n, make sure the\nManage\nbox shows\nCOM Add-ins\n, and then choose\nGo\n.\nAs a precaution, when the\nCOM Add-ins\nlisting of your current add-ins opens, do one of the following:\nManually record the title of every selected add-in listed under\nAvailable Add-ins\n.\nor\nTake a screenshot of the property sheet and save the image to a location of your choice.\nAfter you've captured the titles of the selected add-ins, clear all selected check boxes, and then choose\nOK\n.\nCaution:\nClick a check box to clear it. Don't select an add-in and choose\nRemove\n. If you have administrator rights, you could actually delete the add-in. For this troubleshooting exercise, you want to\ndisable\n, not\ndelete\n, an add-in.\nChoose\nFile\n>\nExit\n.\nRestart\nPress the Windows key + R to open the\nRun\ndialog.\nIn the\nOpen\nbox, type\nOutlook\n.\nNote:\nIf the program loads properly, it's likely that one of your add-ins is the source of the error and you need to identify which one. To determine which add-in is the problem, enable one add-in at a time.\nIn the upper-left corner of Outlook, choose\nFile\n>\nOptions\n>\nAdd-ins\n.\nSelect the check box next to an add-in you want to re-enable and then choose\nOK\n.\nRepeat all steps until you've re-enabled all of the original add-ins and revealed the source of the error.\nImportant:\nRemember, if Outlook opens in safe mode, you've revealed the add-in you just enabled as a source of the error.\nRestart Outlook again and disable the add-in you enabled that produced the problem and then start Outlook.\nMake sure you go through the restart-disable-restart process for\nevery\nadd-in that was originally enabled in Outlook. An error could be caused by more than one add-in.\nCreate a new Outlook profile\nYour profile contains your Outlook settings. Occasionally, that profile can become corrupted. You can determine if it's corrupted by creating a new profile and changing which profile is used when Outlook starts.\nPlease go to\nCreate an Outlook profile\nfor steps on how to create a new Outlook profile, then continue with how to use a different profile.\nUse a different profile\nRestart Outlook.\nIn the drop-down list in the\nChoose Profile\ndialog box, choose the new profile name you created.\nChoose\nOK\n.\nNote:\nIf Outlook starts normally, then you've identified your Outlook profile as being corrupt and the source of your problem.\nShould you decide to remove a profile, back up the data files first. All offline cached content will be deleted when you choose\nRemove\n. For more information, see\nIntroduction to Outlook Data Files (.pst and .ost)\n.\nRepair your Outlook data files\nOutlook stores all your email messages, meetings and events, contacts, and tasks in data files. These files occasionally might become corrupted. You can run the Inbox Repair Tool (\nscanpst.exe\n) to scan your Outlook data files and repair errors.\nExit Outlook to use the Inbox Repair Tool.\nNote:\nThe content in the left pane is determined by the Outlook version you're using.\nVisit the link below for instructions.\nRepair Outlook Data Files (.pst and .ost)\nRun the /resetnavpane command\nThe navigation pane is the leftmost pane in Outlook where you'll find your folder list and the icons to move between Mail, Calendar, People, and Tasks. Running the\n/resetnavpane\ncommand removes all customizations to the navigation pane.\nNote:\nIf you have more than one computer, run the command on all computers because the navigation pane customizations are specific to the local Outlook on a computer.\nClose Outlook.\nPress the Windows key + R to open the\nRun\ndialog.\nIn the\nOpen\nbox, type\nOutlook.exe /resetnavpane\n, and then choose\nOK\n.\nOlder versions of Outlook may be out of support\nFor more information, see\nSupport for Office 2016 and 2019 clients connecting to Microsoft 365 services has ended\n.\nNeed more

After widespread disruption, particularly for POP and PST accounts, Microsoft finally issued emergency fixes to restore stability, but the fallout highlights deeper quality control challenges in its update process and what users need to know now.\nOutlook crashes and frozen apps.\nWhat the emergency update fixes\nHow the update is delivered\nOngoing January update fallout\nWhy so many problems?\nThe original January patch for Windows 11 (KB5074109) caused widespread instability on some systems, most noticeably affecting\nOutlook Classic users\nand apps that work with files stored in cloud-sync folders such as OneDrive and Dropbox.\nThe fix, KB5078127, restores stability for POP and PST Outlook profiles and resolves the unresponsive app behavior introduced earlier this month, making it a must-install for affected systems.\nIt took Microsoft 11 days to release a fix to a problem of their own making and which should have never happened in the first place.  Proper pre-release testing should have detect these problems long before Microsoft’s paying customers were affected.\nOnly Windows 11 users are affected. People who have stayed with Windows 10 can feel a little smug having dodged this bullet 😎.\nOutlook crashes and frozen apps.\nThe most problem hit Outlook Classic (in any version; Microsoft 365, Office 2024/2021 etc), particularly setups using\nPOP email accounts\nand\nPST data files\n.\nMany users found Outlook freezing, crashing, or repeatedly downloading mail. In some cases, sent items failed to appear properly or the app became completely unresponsive when opening PST files stored in synced folders.\nBeyond Outlook, other applications also became sluggish or froze when saving or opening files in cloud-backed locations. For businesses relying on shared folders and synced storage, this quickly became a major problem.\nWhat the emergency update fixes\nKB5078127 specifically fixes the bugs introduced by the January update.  It’s called an ‘update’ but should be called a “bug fix”.\nMicrosoft says it restores normal behavior for Outlook POP and PST profiles and resolves the broader unresponsiveness affecting apps that interact with cloud-synced files.\nFor most affected systems, installing the update should remove the need for workarounds such as uninstalling January’s patches or moving PST files back to local drives.\nHow the update is delivered\nThe emergency fix is being rolled out automatically through\nWindows Update\nfor devices that already have the problematic January patches installed. For most people, the update has probably been installed already or it’ll be offered at\nSettings | Windows Update\nlike this.\nOr check Settings | Windows Update | Update History to see KB5078127 listed.\nAdministrators can also download and deploy\nKB5078127\nmanually via the Microsoft Update Catalog if faster or controlled rollout is needed. A restart is required once the update is applied.\nOngoing January update fallout\nWhile this emergency patch deals with the Outlook and app freezing problems, Microsoft is still investigating other side effects reported after January’s updates, including boot issues on some systems.\nAs usual with rushed fixes, it’s wise to monitor systems closely after installation, but for anyone affected by Outlook crashes or frozen apps, this update is effectively essential.\nThe latest Windows 11 update has not been Microsoft’s proudest hour with many bugs appearing after the public release of the January 2026 updates. But don’t worry, Microsoft management has decades of experience in forgetting their mistakes so the company can repeat the error at a later time <sigh>.\nWhy so many problems?\nMicrosoft isn’t saying why the January 2026 update has been such a disaster.  One popular theory is the over-reliance on AI (as a cost cutting measure) while cutting staff to test updates.\nAnother is that the responsible teams were still recovering from Christmas and New Year celebrations <g>.\nAbout this author\nOffice-Watch.com\nOffice Watch is the independent source of Microsoft Office news, tips and help since 1996.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the problem:\nInstall the Latest Updates\n: Ensure that your Office installation is up to date. Sometimes, issues can arise if updates are not properly installed. You can check for updates through Windows Update or directly in the Office application.\nCheck for Conflicting Processes\n: Make sure that Outlook isn't in use by another process. Sometimes, background processes can interfere with Outlook's performance.\nDisable Add-ins\n: A previously installed add-in may be causing the issue. You can try disabling add-ins to see if that resolves the problem. To do this, go to File > Options > Add-ins and manage your add-ins accordingly.\nRepair Microsoft 365 Programs\n: You can try repairing your Office installation. Go to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features, select Microsoft Office, and choose the Repair option.\nCreate a New User Profile\n: If your user profile has become corrupted, creating a new profile can help. Go to Control Panel > User Accounts > Mail, and then create a new profile.\nRun the Classic Outlook Advanced Diagnostics Troubleshooter\n: This tool can help identify and fix issues with Outlook. Make sure you are using the same Windows device that has classic Outlook installed.\nIf the problem persists after trying these steps, you may want to consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for

A portion of their infrastructure responsible for mailbox connectivity is underperforming. As a result, some users are unable to send/receive messages or may see delayed delivery times and login errors.\nThe disruption began on October 1, 2025 (PST). Microsoft has since identified a configuration change related to the impact, reverted it, and restarted affected infrastructure.\nRecovery is in progress, with service availability steadily improving. Messages that were delayed are now being processed, but it may take some time for the backlog to fully clear.\nMicrosoft is closely monitoring system health and updating customers via the official Service Health Dashboard.\nFor your reference:\nhttps://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/servicehealth/:/alerts/EX1162980\nNote: Access is limited to Microsoft 365 Global Administrator. Please contact your IT admin if you don’t have access.\nAt this stage, no action is required on your part. Once systems are fully restored, Outlook should begin functioning normally again without the need to make changes to your settings or devices.\nI understand how important reliable communication is to you, and I appreciate your patience while Microsoft engineers continue their work behind the scenes.\nIf the answer is helpful, please click \"\nAccept\nAnswer\n\" and kindly upvote it.

I will help you with this.\nTo help narrow down the issue:\nWhat specific error messages are you encountering?\nAre you using Outlook Classic from Microsoft 365 or a stand-alone Outlook version (like Outlook 2019/2021)?\nDoes Outlook freeze immediately when opening, or only after a few minutes?\nIn the meantime, a quick thing you can try is opening Outlook in Safe Mode (this helps check if an add-in is causing the issue):\nPress Windows key + R.\nType\noutlook.exe /safe\nand press Enter\nIf it opens normally in Safe Mode, the issue is very likely caused by an add-in.\nClick \"Add comment\" to let me know.\nRegards,\nJohn J.D.\n0 comments\nNo comments\nReport a concern\nSign in to comment\nAdd comment\nQ&A Assist\n2026-01-22T18:16:49.4966667+00:00\nAI generated content.\nThis question contains an answer created with AI from Q&A Assist.\nLearn more\nThere are several reasons why Outlook might keep freezing on Windows 11. Here are some potential causes and solutions:\nAntivirus Software Integration\n: If your antivirus software integrates with Outlook, it may cause performance issues. You can try disabling this integration or any antivirus add-ins in Outlook. However, be cautious as changing antivirus settings can make your PC vulnerable to threats.\nLarge Mailbox Size\n: If your mailbox size is large, it may require more resources to open folders, leading to performance issues. Consider moving items from larger folders to separate folders or using the AutoArchive feature to manage your mailbox size.\nAppData Folder Redirection\n: If your AppData folder is redirected to a network location, slow network performance can cause Outlook to freeze. You may need to disable this redirection.\nSelective Startup\n: Performing a selective startup can help identify if background applications or services are interfering with Outlook. This is an advanced step and may require some technical knowledge.\nPST Files on Cloud Storage\n: If your PST files are stored on cloud services like OneDrive, this may cause Outlook to become unresponsive. Moving the PST files out of OneDrive can help resolve this issue.\nIf these solutions do not resolve the freezing issue, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for further

you back to sending and receiving your email.\nSelect a tab option below for the version of Outlook you're using.\nWhat version of Outlook do I have?\nNew Outlook\nClassic Outlook\nRestart new Outlook\nRight-click\nStart\nand select\nTask Manager\n.\nSelect\nMicrosoft Outlook\n, then\nEnd task\n.\nCheck to make sure that new Outlook is closed, then close\nTask Manager\n.\nAfter new Outlook closes, reopen the app as you normally would.\nUninstall and reinstall the new Outlook for Windows\nTo uninstall new Outlook:\nFrom the\nStart\nmenu, select\nnew Outlook for Windows\n.\nSelect the arrow to expand the list option in\nStart\n.\nSelect\nUninstall\nto begin the uninstall process.\nTo reinstall new Outlook:\nOpen\nclassic Outlook for Windows\n.\nIn the top corner, you'll see a toggle to\nTry the new Outlook\n.\nSelect this toggle to download the new app and you will switch to the new Outlook for Windows.\nDoes classic Outlook stop running or refuse to start?\nIf you can't open Outlook, or Outlook disappears or crashes, one of your add-ins may be to blame or you may need to update Outlook.\nCheck for updates\nYou might need to set Windows Update to automatically download and install recommended updates. Installing any important, recommended, and optional updates can often correct problems by replacing out-of-date files and fixing vulnerabilities. To install the latest Windows and Office updates, click the link below.\nKeep Windows up to date with the latest Updates\nStart classic Outlook in safe mode\nYou can start Outlook in safe mode, disable your add-ins, and then try to open Outlook normally.\nIn Windows 11, select\nStart\n.\nType Outlook /safe, in the Search programs and files and then click OK.\nClose and re-open Outlook.\nIf the issue is resolved, you can keep working, or if you have time, take the following steps to find out what COM Add-in is causing the problem.\nOpen the\nFile\nmenu, select\nOptions\n, then select\nAdd-ins\n.\nSelect\nCOM Add-ins\nand select\nGo\n.\nClear all the check boxes in the list to disable the Add-ins and select\nOK\n.\nRestart Outlook.\nIf the issue does not occur, go back to the COM Add-ins screen and enable them one at a time until the error occurs. (Be sure to close and restart Outlook after each Add-in is enabled.)\nIs classic Outlook frozen?\nIf you can't choose any of the menu options, type inside an email message, calendar event, or contact, Outlook may have frozen. There are three steps you can take to try to get Outlook working again.\nCheck for other processes running under classic Outlook\nOccasionally, classic Outlook tries to run a process in the background. Auto-archive, sending and receiving a very large attachment, or running some of the other mailbox tools can all be done in the background. Check the status bar at the bottom of the screen to see if another process is running. If so, wait a short time (usually two or three minutes) to see if Outlook starts working again.\nDo you see the message \"This set of folders could not be opened\"?\nIf you can't open a particular set of folders, you can try to repair your personal folders file or create a new profile.\nRepair your .pst file in classic Outlook\nTry following the steps outlined here to repair your .pst file:\nRepair Outlook Data Files (.pst and .ost)\nCreate a new profile in classic Outlook\nTry following the steps outlined here to create a new profile:\nCreate an Outlook profile\nRelated articles\nFixes or
